# Monon Morphotics

Mononic physical identity is classified along a **form axis** and a **material axis**.  
These correspond to:

- **Morphoforms** — the _identity-class_ of the world    
- **Somatypes** — the _material-body regime_ of that world
    
Together, they describe what kind of monon you’re looking at _and_ what its body is made of.
## Morphoforms

All monons fall into one of four broad **morphoforms**, defined by their overall structural character:

- **Lithoform**  
    _(Greek lithos, “stone”)_  
    Fully solid planemons — silicate-rich, metallic, or carbonaceous bodies.
    
- **Rheiform**  
    _(Greek rheo, “to flow”)_  
    Mixed-phase planemons whose interiors combine solids, liquids, and ices. Includes oceanic and volatile-rich worlds.
    
- **Aeriform**  
    _(Latin aer, “air”)_  
    Gaseous or envelope-dominated planemons — gas dwarfs, ice giants, and gas giants.
    
- **Ulsiform**  
    _(Latin uls-, “beyond”)_  
    Exotic or extreme-density bodies. A placeholder for degenerate-matter planemons such as neutron stars, quark stars, or hypothetical compact monons.

# Density Ranges (Approximate)

These density bands describe the typical domains in which each morphoform appears:
- **Lithoform:** $3.5–8.0$ g/cm³ (≈$0.63$⨁ – $1.45$⨁)    
- **Rheiform:** $1.0–3.5$ g/cm³ (≈$0.18$⨁ – $0.63$⨁)    
- **Aeriform:** $0.1–1.0$ g/cm³ (≈$0.018$⨁ – $0.18$⨁)
    
_(Ulsiforms defy simple density classification due to extreme states of matter.)_

These ranges capture **current configurations only**.

Monons may shift morphoforms across time due to thermal evolution, volatile loss, accretion, or phase transitions.
# Somatypes

Each morphoform contains several **somatypes** — the material regimes that express its internal composition and dominant physical state.
## Lithoform Somatypes
- **Petritype** — Silicate-rock planemons (Earth, Vesta, Io).    
- **Carbotype** — Carbon-dominated bodies (graphite planets, diamond-rich worlds).
## Rheiform Somatypes
- **Pagotype** — Ice-rich planemns (H₂O, NH₃, CH₄ ices).    
- **Fluxitype** — Liquid-dominated planemons (ocean worlds, liquid-volatile mantles).
## Aeriform Somatypes
- **Transitype** — Gas dwarfs with high mean molecular weights.    
- **Pneumotype** — Ice giants (CH₄/NH₃/H₂O-rich envelopes).    
- **Halitype** — Gas giants (H/He-dominated envelopes).
## Ulsiform Somatypes (Hypothetical)
- **Quarkotype** — Quark-matter bodies.    
- **Neutrotype** — Neutron-degenerate bodies.    
- **Degenerotype** — Exotic degenerate-matter configurations.
    
These are not expected in most star systems, but are included for conceptual completeness.
# Summary

**Morphoforms** classify the _kind_ of world.  
**Somatypes** classify _what its body is made of._

Every monon can be described by one of each:

> **Earth** → Lithoform / Petritype  
> **Europa** → Rheiform / Pagotype  
> **Neptune** → Aeriform / Pneumotype  
> **Hypothetical quark world** → Ulsiform / Quarkotype

This two-axis system keeps morphotics elegant, scalable, and scientifically legible.
