# Duromon Morphotics
**Duromon Morphotics** defines the structural morphotypes and somatypes expressed by duromonic bodies—objects large enough to support differentiation, sustained internal energetics, and coherent phase domains.

This article explains **what** Lithiform, Rheiform, Aeriform, and Ulsiform morphotypes *are*. For where these appear along the mass continuum, see **Monon Morphotic Mapping**.
# Core Morphotypes

## 1. Lithiform
Rock–metal bodies with solid crusts, differentiated mantles, metallic cores, and stable tectonic potential.
### Key Traits
- Density: **0.85–1.25 ⨁**  
- Silicate mantle + iron core  
- Supports long-term tectonics in mid-mass ranges  
- Only morphotype capable of Terric/Kybelic/Geotic/Gaean classifications  
- Bulk of COH-life potential resides here
## 2. Rheiform
Partially solid, partially molten, or cryo-melt bodies.
### Key Traits
- Intermediate densities  
- Ice-rock mantles, ammonia/water layers  
- Cryovolcanism, slush mantles, fluidic crusts  
- No stable lithospheric tectonics  
- Rarely supports surface COH-life, but may host subsurface animotics
## 3. Aeriform
Bodies dominated by atmospheric mass, with fluid/gas envelopes exceeding lithic layers.
### Key Traits
- Thick volatile atmospheres  
- Deep cloud decks, haze layers  
- Weak or absent solid surfaces  
- Photochemical cycling dominates surface energetics  
- COH-life surface environments are unstable or inaccessible  
- Subsurface oceans may exist beneath gas envelopes
## 4. Ulsiform
Degenerate or near-degenerate matter regimes (found in Transomons, Fusomons, Peromons).
### Key Traits
- Metallic hydrogen, degenerate cores, exotic plasmas  
- No lithic surfaces  
- No COH-life potential  
- Morphotypically distinct from planet-scale behavior
# Somatypes
Somatypes describe *secondary structural identities* that overlay the primary morphotypes.

Examples:
- **Petritype** — rigid crust, thick lithosphere  
- **Fluxitype** — high volcanic or cryovolcanic turnover  
- **Pagotype** — episodic, catastrophic resurfacing  
- **Aerotype** — persistent, global atmospheric dominance  
- **Hydrotype** — global ocean, deep pressure regimes  

Somatypes refine the descriptive power of morphotypes without redefining them.
# Density as a Morphotopic Gatekeeper

Density determines **material class**, not habitability class. The band:

$$
\rho \in (0.85 \cdot\cdot\; 1.25)\oplus
$$

 — defines **Lithiforms**, the *only* bodies capable of sustaining Terric, Kybelic, Geotic, or Gaean characteristics.

### Below 0.85 ⨁
- Volatile-rich  
- Weakly differentiated  
- Icy slush, cryorheiform bodies  
- Not parahabitable
### Above 1.25 ⨁
- Metal-heavy  
- Thin mantles, stagnant-lid tectonics  
- Gravimetrically harsh  
- Not parahabitable
