# Monon Morphotic Mapping
**Monon Morphotic Mapping** describes *where* morphotypes become meaningful across the mass–complexity continuum of monons. It does **not** define the morphotypes themselves—those live in **Duromon Morphotics**. Instead, this article maps the transitions between monon classes and identifies the regimes in which Lithiform, Rheiform, Aeriform, and Ulsiform structures can arise.
## Overview
Morphotics becomes relevant once a monon has enough mass to differentiate, sustain structural phases, and express coherent geochemical or fluid regimes. This begins with the **Varymons** and becomes fully expressed in the **Duromons**.

## The Varymon Mass Regimes

Morphotic expression maps onto the **Duromon** class and its internal mass subclasses. The Varymon Series is not a linear evolutionary ladder; it is a set of parallel mass regimes across different monon superclasses.

### **Monon Superclasses**
- **Synomons** — cohesion without gravitation (pre-duromonic)
- **Duromons** — gravitationally-coherent bodies with solid/liquid phases  
- **Transomons** — partially degenerate bodies (brown-dwarf class)
- **Fusomons** — self-fusing stellar bodies  
- **Peromons** — supermassive, collapse-dominated structures  

### **Duromon Subclasses (Mass-Based)**
Within the *Duromon* superclass, morphotics expresses itself through the following mass regimes:

- **Micromons** — 10⁻⁶–10⁻⁵ ⨁  
  Dust-to-boulder scale; no stable differentiation

- **Minimons** — 10⁻⁴ ⨁  
  Small minor bodies; weak early morphotics

- **Midimons** — 10⁻³ ⨁  
  Major minor bodies; first reliable differentiation

- **Mesomons** — 10⁻² ⨁  
  Dwarf-planemons; stable lithic crusts and internal layering

- **Planemons** — 10⁻¹–10¹ ⨁  
  Full planetary bodies; complete morphotic maturation

Morphotics applies **only** within the Duromon family.  
Transomons, Fusomons, and Peromons express **ulsiform** regimes instead, not lithiform/rheiform/aeriform morphotypes.

For morphotype definitions, see **Duromon Morphotics**.


Morphotics begins at **Micromons**, matures at **Midimons**, and becomes fully stable at the **Planemon** scale.
## Where Each Morphotype Appears

*(See [[Duromon Morphotics]] for full definitions of each morphoform.)*
### Lithiforms
- Require density and internal pressure sufficient for mineral differentiation  
- First appear in mid-sized **Minimons**  
- Fully realized in **Mesomons** and **Planemons**
### Rheiforms
- Require partial melting or cryomelt regimes  
- Common in **icy Mesomons** and **outer-system Planemons**
### Aeriforms
- Require atmospheric mass retention  
- Appear at mid-Mesomon scale  
- Fully expressed in **Planemons** with sustained atmospheres
### Ulsiforms
- Require degenerate or exotic internal pressures  
- Only appear in **Transomons**, **Fusomons**, and **Peromons**
## Morphotic Expression by Monon Class

### Micromons → Minimons
- Weak morphotic expression  
- Insufficient differentiation for stable lithiformity  
- Cryo-rheiform behaviors common in outer-regime bodies
### Midimons
- First stable lithiform crusts and differentiated interiors  
- Rheiform structures appear in volatile-rich bodies  
- Can hold thin, transient aeriform envelopes
### Mesomons
- Fully differentiated interiors  
- Reliable lithiformity  
- Early tectonic regimes
### Planemons
- Full morphotic maturity  
- All four morphoforms (Lithiform, Rheiform, Aeriform, Ulsiform) definable by composition, structure, and internal energetics  
- This is the realm of **Duromon Morphotics**
