# 🌍 The Monon System

A monon is any discrete, self-coherent natural object whose identity arises from a dominant physical regime — whether chemical, mechanical, gravitational, degeneracy-based, fusion-based, or relativistic.

- For synomons → coherence is chemical / mechanical / electrostatic    
- For varymons → coherence is transitional, mixed    
	- For duromons → coherence is gravitational + material physics    
	- For transomons → coherence is partially gravitational + partially thermonuclear / degeneracy    
	- For fusomons → coherence is gravitational but _structured by fusion_    
	- For peromons → coherence is gravitational + relativistic / degeneracy
 
This yields a fully formalized identity system organized into **four structural superclasses**, each defined by the dominant physical regime governing its internal structure and behavior:

# 1. Synomons

### _Sub-duramonic, pre-gravitational monons (< 10⁻⁶ ⨁)_

Bodies that cohere via **chemical, mechanical, or electrostatic forces** rather than gravity.

These include:
- rubble    
- large meteoroids    
- proto-planetesimal fragments    
- sub-kilometer to few-hundred-km aggregates    
- erratics, unconsolidated clusters, and chemically bound bodies    

Synomons are **true monons**, but not varymons or duromons — they occupy the _lowest physical regime_ of mononic identity.
# 2. Varymons
_All gravitationally-coherent monons_

A **varymon** is any monon whose structural cohesion is dominated by **gravitation** rather than chemical or mechanical bonding.  
Everything above the synomon regime is a varymon.

This superclass contains four major subclasses, distinguished by the dominant internal physics shaping each regime:

- **Duromons** — classical-matter varymons  
- **Transomons** — partially degenerate varymons  
- **Fusomons** — fusion-regime varymons  
- **Peromons** — relativistic/exotic varymons
## 2.1. Duromons
### _Matter-regime monons (0.0018 ⨁ → 4131.4 ⨁)_

Bodies whose structure is dominated by **classical matter physics**:
- density    
- composition    
- radius    
- phase state    
- hydrostatic self-cohesion    
- escape velocity    
- non-fusion thermodynamics
    
Duromons are where **Animotics** live.
## 2.2. Transomons
### _Transitional monons (13 M♃ → 80 M♃)_

Bodies bridging planetary and stellar physics, dominated by:
- partial fusion,    
- electron degeneracy pressure,    
- deep convective envelopes,    
- brown-dwarf thermodynamics,    
- and non-hydrogen catalytic fusion episodes.
    
They “borrow rules” from both duromonic and fusomonic regimes.

This superclass includes:
- intermons    
- deuterium-fusors    
- non-hydrogenic fusors
    - the entire L–T–Y dwarf continuum
    
Transomons are the “liminal monons,” bridging duromons and fusomons.
## 2.3. Fusomons
### _Stellar monons (80 M♃ → ~300 M⊙)_

Bodies defined by **sustained core hydrogen fusion**, including:
- main-sequence stars    
- pre-/post-main-sequence fusors    
- spectral-class morphotypes    
- luminosity-cluster somatypes    
- variability families    

The fusomon system already has:
- spectral classes    
- luminosity classes    
- ontozones    
- perannual & nucleal orbit mapping    
- Solar Analogs/Cognates/Twins
    
This is the most "borrowed-in" subsystem in WMB (with some tweaks).
## 2.4. Peromons
### _Ultra-/Supermassive monons (> 1 megaterran)_

Bodies whose structure is dominated by:
- relativity    
- spacetime curvature    
- degenerate pressure    
- accretion physics    
- relativistic mass aggregation    
- event-horizon dynamics    

Including:
- supramons (stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars)    
- ultramons supermassive black holes (SMBHs)    
- hypermons (hypercollapses, primordial monsters, etc.)    

Peromons complete the mononic mass spectrum: the final extreme for independently self-coherent bodies. Larger cosmic masses—clusters, nebulae, galaxies—are vastly more massive, but they are _aggregate systems_, not discrete monons. Synomons define the opposite end of the spectrum, where cohesion is chemical or mechanical rather than gravitational.

# Summary
Together, synomons → duromons → transomons → fusomons → peromons form the complete **Mononic Mass Spectrum**, from chemically-coherent rubble to relativistic collapse objects.
