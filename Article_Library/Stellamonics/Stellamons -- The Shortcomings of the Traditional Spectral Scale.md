# The Shortcomings of the Traditional Spectral Scale

The classWMBl stellar spectral sequence — O, B, A, F, G, K, M — originated as a cataloging system based on observed absorption lines in starlight. It was never designed to be linear, complete, or even particularly rational. And it shows.

> 🔍 *Spectral types weren’t designed — they accreted.*

- Early classifiers like [**Annie Jump Cannon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Jump_Cannon) grouped stars by hydrogen line strength.
- Later work (e.g., by Morgan, Keenan, and [**Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Payne-Gaposchkin)) retrofitted those types to surface temperature.
- The result? **Inconsistent temperature spans**, irregular gaps between classes, and no underlying mathematical symmetry.

### 🌡️ Consider the G–F Discontinuity:

- **F9 → G0**: Drop of only ~$150$ K
- **F0 → F9**: Nearly $1350$ K
- 
- Linear? Not even close.

## 🧭 Why WMB Fixes This

Worldmaking Basics adopts a **linearized spectral system**:

- Each spectral class is assigned a clean temperature range
- Subclasses divide that range evenly
- The system becomes **interpolatable**, **predictable**, and **symbolically clear**

This makes it easier to:

- Calculate stellar parameters from temperature
- Relate stars to their orbits and Thermozones
- Avoid the awkwardness of stars that fall “between classes”

> ⚖️ *The WMB scale isn’t astrophysically perfect — but it’s symbolically powerful, and consistently usable.*

## 📌 BottomLine

If your fiction or modeling needs the exact, messy mess of real-world classification? Use real-world data. 
But if you need a system that supports symbolic structure, habitability logic, and easy computation?

> Mind the gap. 
> Use the line.
