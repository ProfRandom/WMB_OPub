# Solar Analogs, Cognates, and Twins

The published literature often speaks of *solar analog* stars, but tends to be distressingly vague about exactly what the term means. Generally speaking, it means *a star very much like the Sun*.  For our purposes we have our own definitions, based on *orbits* and the animozones. But, first, a survey of existing terminology.

## Existing Definitions
A *Sun-like star* is a broad term used to describe stars that share characteristics with our own Sun. Astronomers often categorize them into a hierarchy based on their *physical* similarity to the Sun. They all need to be main-sequence stars**, actively fusing hydrogen into helium in their core, like our Sun. Otherwise:

**Solar-type Stars:** This is the broadest category. These stars are broadly similar to the Sun in mass and evolutionary state. Key characteristics include: 
 - **Spectral type:** Typically **F8V** ($6300$ K) to **K2V** ($4700$ K) — more on this below.
 
**Solar Analogs:** These stars are more similar to the Sun than general solar-type stars, conforming to stricter criteria:
- **Temperature:** Within approximately $500$ Kelvin (K) of the Sun's temperature (which is about $5800$ K) — between $5300$ K (**G7V**) and $6300$ K (**F8V**). 

**Solar Twins:** This is the most restrictive category, for stars that are nearly identical to the Sun. The idea is that they are virtually indistinguishable from our Sun in as many ways as possible:
- **Temperature:**
	- Within a very narrow range, typically $\pm10$ K of the Sun's temperature — $5790$ K (**G2.1V**) to $5810$ K (**G1.9V**).
	- Some definitions are even stricter, within $\pm5$ K — $5795$ K (**G2.05V**) to $5805$ K (**G1.95V**).
- **Age**:
	- **$4.3$ – $4.7$ Gyr** (The Sun's age $\pm200$ Ma)
 - Sometimes as tight as **$\pm100$ Ma**, i.e., $**4.4$ – $4.6$  Gyr**
# A Proposed, Clearer System

For WMB purposes, our classifications relate directly to the *habitability potential of orbiting planemos*, rather than just their parent stars’ physical resemblance to the Sun.

**Solar Analogs**:
- Stars whose *perannual orbits* fall within $(0.500 \cdot\cdot\; 4.850)$ AU, spanning from [[Orbits, Thermozones, and Animozones|Zone₀ — Zone₅]] ($Z_0 – Z_5$) and spectral types **F2** – **K9**.
- 
**Solar Cognates**:
- Stars whose *perannual orbits* fall within $(0.750 ·· 1.770)$ AU, spanning from [[Orbits, Thermozones, and Animozones|Zone₁ — Zone₄]] ($Z_1 – Z_4$) and spectral types spectral types **F7.62** – **K1.11**.
- 
**Solar Twins**:
- Stars whose *perannual orbits* fall within $(0.950 ·· 1.385)$ AU, spanning from [[Orbits, Thermozones, and Animozones|Zone₃ — Zone₄]] ($Z_1 – Z_4$) and spectral types **G1.04** – **G7.73**.

*Thus*:
- All *Solar Twins* are also *Solar Cognates* and *Solar Analogs*.
- All *Solar Cognates* are also *Solar Analogs*.
- *Solar Analogs* encompass the *Solar Cognate* and *Solar Twin* categories.

> **NOTE**:
> - This perannual-orbit-based requirement is largely arbitrary, predicated on the thesiastic idea that a planemon that is least different from Earth would have an orbital period the same as Earth's.
