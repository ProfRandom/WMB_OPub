## Biotic Order

m := (0.01 ·· 10.00)⨁ 
ρ := (0.50 ·· 7.00)⨁ 
g := (0.15 ·· 8.00)⨁ 
r := (0.15 ·· 3.00)⨁
vₑ := (0.20 ·· 3.00)⨁

> **Biotics** are the full class of rocky, metallic, or icy solid-surface planemons.
> This domain spans everything from Earthlike worlds to massive superterrestrials, frozen dwarfs, scorched tidally-locked crusts, and subplanetary bodies like Ganymede or Titan.
> 
> Biotics are defined purely by **structure** — a solid or semi-solid lithosphere —regardless of habitability, atmosphere, or surface conditions.
### Core Features

- This domain is broad:    
    - **1.7%** of Biotics qualify as **Terric** (habitable)        
    - **0.34%** qualify as **Geotic** (Earthlike-leaning)        
    - **0.17%** qualify as **Gaean** (the sweet-spot ideal)        
    - **~1.2%** qualify as **Kybelic** (super-Earth habitable class)
        
- Biotics possess well-defined surfaces or crusts, but have **no requirement** for environmental habitability, biospheres, or atmospheric stability.    
- Many are **parahabitable**—survivable only with domes, subsurface refugia, or environmental engineering.   
- This category includes:    
    - sub-Earths and dwarfs        
    - Earthlike and super-Earth rocky planets        
    - crusted ocean worlds        
    - cryogenic outer-system bodies        
    - irradiated volcanic hyperterrestrials
### Relations to Other Categories

- **Biotic** is the **parent domain** of the **Terric** and **Geotic** Domains and the **Gaean Province**, which is itself nested within Geotic.  
    All members of those narrower classes are, by definition, **Biotic**.    
- **Kybelic** worlds partially overlap Biotics.  
    All Kybelics fall within Biotic structural–chemical allowances, but only a small fraction of Biotics meet Kybelic conditions.    
- **Xenotic** worlds are defined by their **non-carbonic, non-water-solvent biotic potential**, not by their structure.
	- They may have rocky crusts, Earthlike densities, and familiar surface conditions —  
		  **but if their chemistry supports _alien_ bioregimes rather than terragen ones, they are classified as Xenotic, not Biotic.**
    
    In short:    
    - Biotic = _within terragen biochemical possibility_        
    - Xenotic = _outside terragen biochemical possibility_
	-  The two use **different axes** of classification and do **not** overlap in category.
### Symbolic Use

- **Biotic = all solid-earth planemons**, the material envelope from which all habitable and quasi-habitable subclasses descend.    
- When contrasted with _Xenotic_, the distinction is **physical** rather than biological:  
- **Biotic** describes _worlds whose physical conditions fall within the possible envelope for carbonic–water–oxygen life_, regardless of whether they are actually habitable.  
    It is a **structural + chemical regime aligned with terragen biochemistry**.
- **Xenotic** describes _worlds whose physical or chemical environment favors non-carbonic biochemistries_ — ammonia, hydrocarbons, silicon-chain chemistries, supercritical solvents, etc.  
    They may resemble Biotics physically, but they lie **outside the terragen-life regime**.
