# Biotic Order

m := (0.01 ·· 10.00)⨁ 
ρ := (0.50 ·· 2.18)⨁
r := (0.15 ·· 3.00)⨁
g := (0.15 ·· 8.00)⨁ 
vₑ := (0.20 ·· 3.00)⨁

$$
\text{BIOTIC} := \left\{
\begin{aligned}
	&0.01 ≤ m ≤ 10.00 \\
	&0.50 ≤ \rho ≤ 2.18 \\
	&0.15 ≤ r(m, \rho) ≤ 3.00 \\
	&0.15 ≤ g(m, r) ≤ 8.00 \\

## Core Statistics

**Biotic** is the **parent order** of the **Terric Domain**, the **Geotic Realm**, and the **Gaean Province**.  All members of those narrower types are, by definition, **Biotic**.    

About $1$ in $9.6$ ($0.1037$%) duramons are biotic worlds, and within the biotic order: 
    - About $1.7$% of Biotics are in the broadest [[Terric Domain]] (parahabitable)        
    - The [[Geotic Realm]] (human-habitables) account for about $0.34$% of all Biotics (habitable)        
    - The [[Gaean Province]] (human-hospitable worlds) account for about $0.17$% of all Biotics (about half of all Geotics)        
    - The [[Kybelic Domain]] is the "superhabitable" counterpart of the Terric Domain.
	    - About $\approx 1.2$% of all Biotics qualify as **Kybelic** (parahabitable for humans; highly animegic to carboxyhydroxyl life), a slightly smaller percentage than the Terric Domain.
        

## <u>Important Note</u>

**The Biotic phase space defines the _physical_ conditions under which COH-amegic life is _possible_, not guaranteed.**  A duramon falls within the Biotic Order if its mass, radius, density, surface gravity, and escape velocity occupy the narrow region of parameter space in which **COH solvents, COH chemistry, and surface-accessible metabolisms could, in principle, arise and persist.**

Worlds _outside_ the Biotic phase space are **physically unlikely** to host COH life, because they cannot maintain the structural or energetic conditions required for liquid-phase biochemistry.

Worlds _inside_ the Biotic phase space are not necessarily COH-amegic — many will lack oceans, atmospheres, or stable climates. They simply possess the **structural eligibility** for such systems to exist.

The narrower Animotic classes ([[Terric Domain|Terric]] → [[Geotic Realm|Geotic]] → [[Gaean Province|Gaean]]) represent progressively smaller regions of this same phase space where a world’s physical properties are **increasingly well-tuned** for COH-amegicity. These classes describe **potential**, not environmental actuality; the realization of that potential is governed by Milieutic factors such as atmosphere, hydrosphere, stellar flux, and planetary history.

Being Biotic does not guarantee the presence of COH life; it only guarantees the _possibility_ of COH life given appropriate environmental conditions and planetary history.

# Earth Examples of Biotic Environments
Below are some examples from Earth's geological history which help to clarify the Terric, Geotic, Gaean, and even Kybelic phase spaces:
## 1. Hadean–Early Archean Earth → Biotic (barely)

- COH-chemistry barely viable    
- early oceans, high volcanic activity    
- UV-high atmosphere, no oxygen    
- life only microbial, extremophile    
- humans: die instantly _if exposed_, but environment itself isn’t chemically incompatible → stays Biotic
    
Earth is “proto-biotic” — the wide, inclusive bottom category.
## 2. Archean–Ediacaran Earth → TERRIC DOMAIN (parahabitable)

### Why Earth was **Terric** here:

- Gravity normal    
- Pressures normal    
- Liquid water abundant    
- COH life thriving    
- But atmosphere unbreathable (low O₂)    
- High greenhouse gases    
- High UV / no ozone    
- Planet absolutely survivable for humans **with PPE gear**
    
Terric doesn’t require _comfort_ — it requires _non-lethality_ and _COH compatibility_.
## 3. Late Ediacaran–Phanerozoic Earth → GEOTIC REALM (human-habitable)

As oxygen rose and multicellularity exploded:
- breathable with adaptation    
- stable climate ranges    
- day-night equilibrium    
- continents supporting ecology    
- rich nutrient cycles    
- high biodiversity
- ocean–land energy exchange stabilizing environment    
- complex atmospheric feedback loops    
- survivable with light gear in _most_ environments
    
This is **Habitable Earth**, not yet _perfect for humans_, not tropical-Golden-Age everywhere, but absolutely Geotic.
## 4. Carboniferous Earth (peak O₂) → KYBELIC DOMAIN (superanimegic)

### Why Earth was Kybelic (_superanimegic) then:

- O₂ at 30–35%    
- Gigantism in insects and vegetation    
- Hyper-biodiversity    
- Extremely high NPP (net primary productivity)    
- Warm, humid, lush planetwide forests    
- Rapid ecological cycling    
- Abundant shallow seas    
- Planet functioning at peak animegy    

Kybelic isn’t “better for humans,” it’s **biologically overclocked**.
## 5. Holocene Earth (modern) → GAEAN PROVINCE

The goldilocks sweet spot:
- breathable    
- temperate regions    
- stable climate    
- land/ocean feedbacks    
- extant multicellular ecosystems    
- human-hospitable environment    
- diverse biomes    
- atmospheric transparency ideal for photosynthesis    
- C/N/O/H cycling optimized    
- high but not runaway O₂
    
This is “walk outside barefoot and eat a berry” territory.

# 🌍 Earth Became COH-Amegic Almost Immediately

At least — that is the current scientific consensus.
## 1. Surface solidifies (~4.4 Ga)
- Molten hellscape → thin crust → condensation of the first oceans.
## 2. Water present (~4.3–4.2 Ga)
- Zircon oxygen isotopes, inclusion analyses, mineralogy all suggest stable surface water almost as soon as the crust existed.
## 3. Prebiotic chemistry (~4.2–4.1 Ga)
- With liquid water, abundant carbon, usable-  energy sources, and clays + metal sulfides for catalysis, COH chemistry begins immediately.
##  4. Life appears (~4.1–3.8 Ga)
- Evidence from:
	- carbon fractionation signatures    
	- microfossils (controversial but increasingly supported)    
	- stromatolitic structures    
	- sedimentary isotropic ratios    

These facts radically suggest that life was present **within 200–300 million years** of Earth cooling: in cosmic terms:  > _“Basically instantly.”_

This means:
	 **Earth has been COH-amegic for nearly 4 billion years**

Even when:
- atmosphere was CH₄ heavy    
- oceans were hot and acidic    
- continents were tiny    
- solar UV was higher    
- no oxygen existed    
- ecosystems were microbial only    
- sky was likely orange, not blue
    
Earth was still:
- ✔ fully COH-compatible
- ✔ chemically consistent with biological metabolism
- ✔ supporting active animegy

In WMB terms: **COH-Amegic since the late Hadean.**

# 🌎 **Where Earth falls in the Animotic Hierarchy**

Here’s the clean canonical mapping:

| Earth Stage             | Animotic Class         | Why                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hadean/Archean**      | Biotic                 | COH-positive, but unbreathable and hostile to humans.      |
| **Archean–Proterozoic** | Terric                 | Parahabitable: safe to stand on with gear; not breathable. |
| **Ediacaran–Cambrian**  | Border Terric → Geotic | Oxygen rising; atmosphere stabilizing; still variable.     |
| **Phanerozoic (most)**  | Geotic                 | Human-habitable ecosystems.                                |
| **Carboniferous peak**  | Kybelic                | High O₂, mega-biodiversity, hyper-animegy.                 |
| **Modern Earth**        | Gaean                  | Human-hospitable sweet spot.                               |
