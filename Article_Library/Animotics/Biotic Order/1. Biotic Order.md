# Biotic Order

$$
\text{BIOTIC} := \left\{
\begin{aligned}
	&0.05 ≤ m ≤ 3 \\
	&0.35 ≤ \rho ≤ 2.18 \\
	&0.35 ≤ r(m, \rho) ≤ 2.30 \\
	&0.25 ≤ g(m, r) ≤ 3.00 \\
	&0.30 ≤ v_e(g, r) ≤ 2.63
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$
## Core Statistics

The **Biotic Order** is the broad amegic class containing every world capable of supporting **COH-life** in general. It is the parent population from which the more anthropically meaningful Terric, Geotic, and Gaean subsets are drawn.

Across the full duromonic phase space, **about 1 in 1,695 duromons (≈0.06%)** meet the Biotic criteria.

Within the Biotic Order itself:
- **≈ 41.5% are Terric** — the **mesanthropic** worlds: broadly COH-friendly and moderately human-tolerant.    
- **≈ 6.8% are Geotic** — the **maxanthropic** subset: consistently human-friendly, Earth-adjacent in structure.    
- **≈ 1.7% are Gaean** — the **melanthropic** peak: genuinely “shirtsleeve” worlds, deeply Earth-analog in multiple dimensions.    

In addition:
- **≈ 1.7% of all Biotics qualify as Kybelic** — the **melamegic** branch of COH-life worlds: superproductive, superstable, and optimized for biospheric vigor rather than for human comfort.
    
These categories are **nested anthropically** (Terric → Geotic → Gaean) and **lateral amegically** (Terric ↔ Kybelic), reflecting the two independent axes of biological suitability in WMB.        

## <u>Important Note: What "Biotic" Really Means</u>

**The Biotic phase space defines where COH-life is _possible_ — not where it actually exists.**

A duramon qualifies as **Biotic** if its mass, radius, density, gravity, and escape velocity fall within the narrow region where **liquid-phase COH chemistry, COH solvents, and accessible surface metabolism** are _physically viable_.
- Worlds **outside** Biotic ranges are _structurally incompatible_ with COH-life.    
- Worlds **inside** Biotic ranges may still be sterile, toxic, or climatologically disastrous.
    

In other words:
**Biotic = physically eligible, not necessarily biologically realized.**
Environmental, historical, and stellar conditions (Milieutics) still determine whether biology actually happens.
The narrower classes — **Terric → Geotic → Gaean** — represent progressively smaller subsets whose _physical conditions increasingly favor COH-ppositivity_:
- **Terric**: structurally compatible, human-survivable with gear (**mesanthropic**)    
- **Geotic**: broadly Earthlike in structure and human-habitable (**maxanthropic**)    
- **Gaean**: truly “shirtsleeve worlds” (**melanthropic**)

None of these guarantee life; they guarantee **possibility and structural support**.

# **🌍 Earth as a Case Study of Biotic → Terric → Geotic → Gaean → Kybelic**

The Earth’s own 4.5 billion-year history is a remarkable tour through nearly the entire biotic hierarchy.  Below is a streamlined, accurate mapping of how Earth’s classification shifts through time.

## 1. Hadean–Early Archean Earth → *Biotic (barely)*
- Liquid water present    
- Crust thin, volcanism extreme    
- Atmosphere anoxic, UV-intense    
- COH chemistry viable, but conditions brutal    
- Microbial life plausible; human life impossible without total isolation    

**Earth is structurally COH-compatible, but nothing like Terric yet.**
## 2. Archean–Proterozoic Earth → *Terric Domain (mesanthropic)*
Why Terric here?
- Normal gravity / radius    
- Stable oceans    
- COH life abundant    
- Atmosphere unbreathable (low O₂)    
- Strong greenhouse forcing    
- Dangerous UV levels    

Humans could survive only with gear — but the planet is **fundamentally compatible** with COH life.
## 3. Late Proterozoic–Cambrian Earth → *Terric → Geotic Transition*
- Oxygen rising    
- Stratospheric ozone forming    
- Expanding continental shelves    
- Multicellularity emerging    
- Climate stabilization improving    

This is the **threshold** where Earth moves into the **maxanthropic** zone.

## 4. Phanerozoic Earth (most eras) → *Geotic Realm (maxanthropic)*
- Breathable for humans (with acclimation)    
- Stable climate bands    
- Complex land/ocean cycles    
- High biodiversity    
- Planet behaves like “Earth,” because… well… it is.    

This is Earth in its broadly human-habitable mode.
## 5. Carboniferous Peak → *Kybelic Domain (melamegic)*
Why Kybelic (melamegic)?
- O₂ at 30–35%    
- Global forests    
- Mega-insect gigantism    
- Massive net primary productivity (NPP)    
- Humid, warm, nutrient-rich    
- Biosphere “overclocked” relative to modern    

Kybelic ≠ “better for humans” — it means **more biologically intense**.
## 6. Holocene Earth → *Gaean Province (melanthropic)*
Earth at its anthropic best:
- Breathable oxygen    
- Global biomes    
- Transparent atmosphere    
- Balanced C/N/O/H cycles    
- Temperate climate regions    
- Walk-outside-and-eat-a-berry conditions    

This is the **peak anthropic state**.
# ⏳ Earth Became COH-Amegic Shockingly Early
Modern research suggests:
- Stable water: ~4.3–4.2 Ga    
- Prebiotic chemistry: ~4.2–4.1 Ga    
- Earliest life: ~4.1–3.8 Ga    

Meaning:
> **Earth became COH-amegic within ~200–300 million years of forming.**

That’s borderline instantaneous on cosmic timescales.
# # **📍 Earth’s Animotic Classification by Era**

| **Earth Stage**      | **Animotic Class**  | **Reason**                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hadean–Early Archean | **Biotic**          | COH-compatible, but deadly atmosphere & high violence. |
| Archean–Proterozoic  | **Terric**          | Human-survivable w/ gear; COH life thriving.           |
| Late Proterozoic     | **Terric → Geotic** | Oxygen rising; improving climate stability.            |
| Most Phanerozoic     | **Geotic**          | Human-habitable conditions broadly in effect.          |
| Carboniferous        | **Kybelic**         | Hyperproductive super-amegic biosphere.                |
| Modern Holocene      | **Gaean**           | Fully anthropic sweet spot.                            |
