> *Kybelics* are **parahabitable** planemons — terrestrial super-Earths with conditions **favorable to rich biospheres** but likely **inhospitable to unmodified humans**. They may possess higher surface gravity, thicker atmospheres, and more energetic climates, often demanding mechanical, biological, or infrastructural adaptations for long-term Earthling presence. Nonetheless, they are considered highly conducive to complex, robust life — just not necessarily Earthlike.

**Overlap with Gaeans**:
- A **small subset** of Kybelics — **≈13.9%** — fall within the Gaean gravity range (0.9 ≤ g ≤ 1.1⨁). 
- These rare worlds are **massive and dense** enough to support Earth-normal surface conditions **while offering enhanced biospheric potential** — possibly the best of both worlds.
**Core Feature**:
- The **“superhabitable” zone**: larger size means broader climatic bands, more plate tectonics, greater magnetic shielding, and longer tectonic–volcanic cycling — all of which may favor biospheric richness and diversity. 
- **Human settlement** is plausible but typically **requires support**: enhanced structural design, medical mitigation of gravity effects, and climate regulation systems.
**Distinction from Geotics**:
- All Kybelics meet **Geotic** compositional constraints, but their **mass and gravity trends upward**. 
- **Not all Geotics** are Kybelic: Kybelics are a **subset of high-mass, dense, habitable** planemons. 
- Conversely, **not all Kybelics are Gaean** — only a small slice of them match that precise Earthlike window.

# Kybelic planemons

**Definition** 
The concept of *superhabitable planemons* was proposed by René Heller and John Armstrong (2014) to describe worlds with physical, orbital, and stellar characteristics that make them **more conducive to rich, diverse biospheres** than Earth — though not necessarily more suitable for humanoid or Earthlike life.

**Stellar Criteria** 
- Host star mass range: (0.359 ·· 0.817)⊙ (spectral classes M0··G9)
- Host star lifespan: (1.656 ·· 12.934)⊙ years 
- Stellar age: Older than the Sun’s 4.5 Ga but younger than 7 Ga 

**Planemon Characteristics** 
- **Mass**: (2.0 ·· 3.0)⨁ (optimum ≈ 2.0⨁) 
- **Radius**: (1.260 ·· 1.442)⨁ (maintains Earthlike density and gravity) 
- **Geology**: Larger tectonic–volcanic cycling, longer plate tectonic activity, strong carbon–silicate cycle, thicker atmosphere retention. 
- **Magnetic Field**: Stronger due to larger liquid core and higher internal heat. 
- **Surface Geography**: Flatter topography, shallower oceans, widely distributed ocean coverage (~71% surface area) without large continuous land masses. 
- **Temperature**: Mean ≈ 25 °C (77 °F). 
- **Atmosphere**: Thicker than Earth’s; O₂ concentration > 20.95%. 
- **Orbit**: Closer to the center of the host system’s habitable zone than Earth is in the Solar System. 
 - Solar System example: center of optimistic HZ ≈ 1.26 AU; center of conservative HZ ≈ 1.16 AU.

**Scientific Rationale** 
From Heller & Armstrong (2014): 
> “Terrestrial planemons that are slightly more massive than Earth, up to 2 or 3 M⊕, are preferably superhabitable due to the longer tectonic activity, a carbon–silicate cycle active on a longer timescale, enhanced magnetic shielding, larger surface area, smoother surface, thicker atmosphere, and the positive effects of non-intelligent life on habitability.”

Lena Noack & Doris Breuer (2011) add: 
> “…the propensity of plate tectonics seems to have a peak between 1 and 5 Earth masses… a geological perspective suggests the optimal mass of a planemon is about 2 M⊕.”

**Relation to WCB Classifications** 
In *Worlds by the Numbers*, **Kybelic planemons** encompass the superhabitable concept, with parameter refinements for internal consistency within WCB’s classification system.

## Superhabitables and Mass: Beyond “Just Right”

In 2014, René Heller and John Armstrong proposed the existence of **superhabitable planemons** — worlds that may be **more conducive to life** than Earth, even if not ideal for humans. These planemons are theorized to exceed Earth's habitability not by matching its parameters exactly, but by surpassing them in specific, life-favoring ways.
### 📌 Definition:

> A **superhabitable** world is one that provides **enhanced conditions** for the *emergence, proliferation, and persistence* of life — especially diverse, adaptive, and long-lasting biospheres.
> 
> In *Worldcrafting 101* terms, these may be considered **mega-animotic** worlds: not only capable of supporting life, but actively *better* at nurturing it.

#### 🔸 Key Mass-Linked Traits of Superhabitables

- **According to Heller & Armstrong, ideal superhabitable worlds are:**
	- **Slightly more massive than Earth**, typically **(1.200 ∧ 2.000) ⨁**, with upper candidates up to **3.000 ⨁** 
	- **Geologically more persistent**: higher mass leads to **longer tectonic lifespans** 
	- **Thermally buffered**: more efficient retention of internal heat extends mantle convection and volcanism 
	- **Better magnetic shielding**: large, slowly cooling cores sustain **stronger and longer-lived magnetospheres** 
	- **Larger surface area**: more room for ecological diversification, especially with flatter terrain 
	- **Thicker atmospheres**: improved radiation shielding, more stable greenhouse effect 
	- **More shallow seas**: potentially broader tidal zones and nutrient-rich photic environments
- **Implications**
	- Mass increases above ~1.500 ⨁ usually signal **rising risk**, particularly for **Earthlike** surface biology. But for generalized **animotic potential**, the picture is more nuanced.
	 - A world with 1.600–2.000⨁ mass and moderate density (0.800 ∧ 1.100)⨁ may maintain: 
		- Surface gravity in the ≈ (1.200 ∧ 1.400)⨁ range (still viable)
		- Escape velocity high enough to retain a thick but breathable atmosphere
		- Internal heat sufficient to power tectonics for billions of years
- **Tradeoffs**
	- Superhabitability does not mean superhuman-friendliness:
		- **Biomechanical costs** rise as gravity increases 
		- **Space access** becomes difficult (high vₑ​) 
		- **Photosynthetically active radiation** may differ under cooler stars 
		- **Dense, moist atmospheres** may favor different metabolisms and chemistries 
	- These are worlds where **life flourishes**, but **not necessarily your life**.
- **Superhabitables are not exceptions to the Geotic envelope 
	- They are edge-pushing optimals within a carefully constrained corner of it**:
		- **Mass**: (1.200 ∧ 2.000) ⨁
		- **Density**: (0.800 ∧ 1.100) ⨁
		- **Gravity**: (1.100 ∧ 1.400) ⨁
		- **Tectonics**: Active over 5+ Gyr
	 - **Magnetosphere**: Sustained by large convective iron core
	 - **Star**: Spectral class M0–G9 (mass ∈ (0.359 ∧ 0.817) ☉)
- **Superhabitables challenge anthropocentric bias**
	- They show that **habitability isn’t a peak — it’s a plateau**
	- Mass above 1.500⨁ doesn’t always push you into hazard space; under the right conditions, it **creates biological opportunity**. In such cases, higher mass may be not a warning sign — but an invitation.
