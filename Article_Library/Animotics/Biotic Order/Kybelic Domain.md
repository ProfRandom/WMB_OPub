> *Kybelics* are **parahabitable** planemons — terrestrial super-Earths with conditions **favorable to rich biospheres** but likely **inhospitable to unmodified humans**. They may possess higher surface gravity, thicker atmospheres, and more energetic climates, often demanding mechanical, biological, or infrastructural adaptations for long-term Earthling presence. Nonetheless, they are considered highly conducive to complex, robust life — just not necessarily Earthlike.

**Overlap with Gaeans**:
- A **small subset** of Kybelics — **≈13.9%** — fall within the Gaean gravity range (0.9 ≤ g ≤ 1.1⨁). 
- These rare worlds are **massive and dense** enough to support Earth-normal surface conditions **while offering enhanced biospheric potential** — possibly the best of both worlds.
**Core Feature**:
- The **“superhabitable” zone**: larger size means broader climatic bands, more plate tectonics, greater magnetic shielding, and longer tectonic–volcanic cycling — all of which may favor biospheric richness and diversity. 
- **Human settlement** is plausible but typically **requires support**: enhanced structural design, medical mitigation of gravity effects, and climate regulation systems.
**Distinction from Geotics**:
- All Kybelics meet **Geotic** compositional constraints, but their **mass and gravity trends upward**. 
- **Not all Geotics** are Kybelic: Kybelics are a **subset of high-mass, dense, habitable** planemons. 
- Conversely, **not all Kybelics are Gaean** — only a small slice of them match that precise Earthlike window.

# Kybelic planemons

**Definition** 
The concept of *superhabitable planemons* was proposed by René Heller and John Armstrong (2014) to describe worlds with physical, orbital, and stellar characteristics that make them **more conducive to rich, diverse biospheres** than Earth — though not necessarily more suitable for humanoid or Earthlike life.

**Stellar Criteria** 
- Host star mass range: ⟨0.359 ∧ 0.817⟩⊙ (spectral classes M0∧G9)
- Host star lifespan: ⟨1.656 ∧ 12.934⟩⊙ years 
- Stellar age: Older than the Sun’s 4.5 Ga but younger than 7 Ga 

**Planemon Characteristics** 
- **Mass**: ⟨2.0 ∧ 3.0⟩⨁ (optimum ≈ 2.0⨁) 
- **Radius**: ⟨1.260 ∧ 1.442⟩⨁ (maintains Earthlike density and gravity) 
- **Geology**: Larger tectonic–volcanic cycling, longer plate tectonic activity, strong carbon–silicate cycle, thicker atmosphere retention. 
- **Magnetic Field**: Stronger due to larger liquid core and higher internal heat. 
- **Surface Geography**: Flatter topography, shallower oceans, widely distributed ocean coverage (~71% surface area) without large continuous land masses. 
- **Temperature**: Mean ≈ 25 °C (77 °F). 
- **Atmosphere**: Thicker than Earth’s; O₂ concentration > 20.95%. 
- **Orbit**: Closer to the center of the host system’s habitable zone than Earth is in the Solar System. 
 - Solar System example: center of optimistic HZ ≈ 1.26 AU; center of conservative HZ ≈ 1.16 AU.

**Scientific Rationale** 
From Heller & Armstrong (2014): 
> “Terrestrial planemons that are slightly more massive than Earth, up to 2 or 3 M⊕, are preferably superhabitable due to the longer tectonic activity, a carbon–silicate cycle active on a longer timescale, enhanced magnetic shielding, larger surface area, smoother surface, thicker atmosphere, and the positive effects of non-intelligent life on habitability.”

Lena Noack & Doris Breuer (2011) add: 
> “…the propensity of plate tectonics seems to have a peak between 1 and 5 Earth masses… a geological perspective suggests the optimal mass of a planemon is about 2 M⊕.”

**Relation to WCB Classifications** 
In *Worlds by the Numbers*, **Kybelic planemons** encompass the superhabitable concept, with parameter refinements for internal consistency within WCB’s classification system.
