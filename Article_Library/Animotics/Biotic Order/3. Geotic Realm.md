## Geotic Realm

$$
\text{GEOTIC} := \left\{ 
\begin{aligned}
&0.60 ≤ m ≤ 1.80 \\
&0.85 ≤ \rho ≤ 1.25 \\
&0.66 ≤ r(m, \rho) ≤ 1.61 \\
&0.76 ≤ g(m, \rho) ≤ 1.40 \\
&0.71 ≤ v_e(m, \rho) ≤ 1.30

## Core Statistics
- Geotics are rare:  **0.004%** of all duromons (**1 in 25000).
- They make up **6.8% of all Biotics**.

>**Geotics** are closer to  **Earthlike** — worlds whose physical properties cluster nearer those of Earth, offering **stable, moderate, and biocompatible environments** that support long-term carbonic life with minimal modification.

They represent the **narrow center band** of the Terric Realm: physically close to Earth in gravity, size, composition, and escape energy, but not so human-amegic as the [[4. Gaean Province]].

Geotics are the **backbone category** for stable, Earth-normal ecosystems.
## What Counts as Geotic
**Geotics occupy the Earthlike core of the Terric Domain** — the zone where a world’s physical structure naturally supports a stable hydrosphere, breathable atmospheres (with minimal tuning), and long-term COH-amegic.

They are:
- **mass-balanced** enough for plate tectonics and magnetic shielding    
- **density-balanced** for silicate–metal compositions
- **gravity-balanced** for familiar biomechanics and atmospheric retention    
- **escape-velocity-balanced** for temperate climate cycling    
- **radius-balanced** for Earth-mode heat budgets and circulation    

Together, these conditions form the **Earthlike structural envelope**: not perfect replicas of Earth, but worlds where COH-life can thrive without engineering.

## Position in the Taxonomy

> **Terric Domain → Geotic Realm → Gaean Province**

Geotics are the **Realm-level class**, broader than the Gaeans but far more selective than Terrics.  
Where Gaeans mirror Earth precisely, **Geotics allow Earthlike diversity** — warm, cool, wet, dry, lush, sparse, but always fundamentally habitable.

They are the **canonical “living worlds”** of the WMB: stable, moderate, fertile, and evolution-friendly.
# Justifying The Geotic Limits
Defining the boundaries of the Geotic classification is more than a technical choice; it is a declaration about what counts as genuinely Earthlike. These limits—set in mass, density, radius, surface gravity, and escape velocity—are not arbitrary outputs of equations. They arise from the convergence of empirical constraint, biological insight, and a philosophy of life’s tolerances. In this sense, the Geotic envelope is an ontological bridge between what the cosmos permits and what COH-life can plausibly endure.

The Geotic envelope is intentionally narrow: broad enough to include the full diversity of worlds plausibly habitable to COH-life, yet not so permissive that “habitable” collapses into meaninglessness. Its limits encompass the functional extremes of terrestrial embodiment—gravities low enough for human physiology to operate, yet high enough to sustain atmospheric retention; densities consistent with silicate–metal worlds without straying into exotic regimes; radii that permit active tectonics and stable geochemistry while remaining well below the threshold of gas-giant formation.

These ranges also pass through an explicitly interpretive lens—one that recognizes that scientific limits are never entirely separable from lived perspective. We invoke the Anthropic Principle not as a loophole, but as an observational truth: COH-life emerges where its prerequisites align, and those prerequisites shape how we draw our boundaries. The Geotic limits therefore reflect both the statistical plausibility of Earthlike biology and the philosophical humility to admit that our definitions carry the imprint of our own experience.

To be Geotic is to stand within the true corridor of habitability—neither perched on the narrow summit of Earth-precise parameters, as in the Gaean Province, nor cast into the exotic fringes of the Xenotic. It marks the threshold where Earthlike life becomes not merely conceivable, but genuinely supported: a balanced middle ground in a cosmos that promises nothing yet offers countless invitations for life to take root.
# Summary
**Geotics are the solid middle band of true Biotic animegics — the worlds where COH-life can flourish without exceptional circumstance or intervention.** They anchor the Terric Domain and provide the structural and ecological footing from which the rarer Gaean worlds emerge.
