## Kybelic Domain

$$
\text{KYBELIC} := \left\{
\begin{aligned}
&1.00 ≤ m ≤ 2.00 \\
&0.9 ≤ \rho ≤ 1.10 \\
&1.20 ≤ r(m, \rho) ≤ 1.40 \\
&1.10 ≤ g(m, \rho) ≤ 1.40 \\
&1.15 ≤ v_e(m, \rho) ≤ 1.40
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$
## What Are Kybelics?

**Kybelics** are **melamegic** planemons — robust, high-mass terrestrial worlds whose physical structure supports **exceptional COH-life productivity**, even if they are **not comfortable for humans**.

They are **not** “better Earths,” nor are they necessarily Earthlike.  They are **melamegic**, not melanthropic.

A Kybelic world typically features:
- **Higher gravity** (1.1–1.4g)    
- **Thicker atmospheres**    
- **Stronger magnetic fields**    
- **Long-lived tectonic cycling**    
- **Deep, stable hydrospheres**    
- **Highly productive biospheres (melamegy)**
    
These are the worlds where COH-life absolutely thrives, but humans survive only with ongoing technological support.

Terran plants and Earth animals struggle; native life thrives.
## 🎯 Taxonomic Position (Critical Clarity)
Kybelics are:
- **morphotically a subset** to Terrics, but    
- **animotically lateral** to Terrics    
- **not a subset of Geotics**    
- **not a subset of Gaeans**    
- **never Gaean**, because their gravity prevents human hospitability
    
This is exactly like William the Conqueror being both:
- **a peer monarch (King of England)**    
- **and a vassal (Duke of Normandy)**    

Kybelics sit _inside_ Terric mass–density space morphotically, yet _outside_ Terric anthropic space functionally.
## Why Kybelics Matter in Animotics
Kybelics represent the **melamegic apex** of COH-amegy:
- maximum photosynthetic productivity    
- lush, high-turnover ecosystems    
- massive biomass    
- stable, deep evolutionary capacity    
- global net primary productivity far higher than Earth’s    
- extremely long tectonic–volcanic cycles    
- rich nutrient and redox diversity    

If Terrics are mesanthropic, and Geotics are maxanthropic, then **Kybelics are melamegic** — the “peak COH-potential worlds.”

They are **excellent Cradles of Life**, but **mediocre Homes for Humans**.
