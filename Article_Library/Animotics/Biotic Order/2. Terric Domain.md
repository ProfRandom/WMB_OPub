## Terric Domain

$$
\text{TERRIC} := \left\{ 
\begin{aligned}
&0.40 ≤ m ≤ 2.35 \\
&0.35 ≤ \rho ≤ 2.18 \\
&0.52 ≤ r(m, \rho) ≤ 1.86 \\
&0.68 ≤ g(m, \rho) ≤ 1.50 \\
&0.70 ≤ v_e(m, \rho) ≤ 1.40
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$

>**Terrics** are the **mesanthropic** COH-amegic worlds — solid-surface planemons whose physical structure is compatible with carbon–water biochemistry and potentially survivable for humans with moderate technological support. They are not necessarily Earthlike, but they fall firmly within the realm where COH metabolism, weathering cycles, hydrospheres, and plate tectonics _can_ function.

Terrics form the **broadest physically meaningful envelope** of the Biotic Order.
# Core Statistics
- Terrics account for **0.0245% of all duromons** (about **1 in 4,082**).    
- They make up **41.5% of all Biotics**.    
- **All Geotics and all Gaeans are Terrics**, but Terrics allow more diversity in mass, density, and climate stability than either.### Implications and Examples

# What Worlds Count as Terric?
Terrics include:
### Low-End Terrics
- light, cold, thin-aired sub-Earths    
- worlds in early oxygen-poor stages    
- solar-wind–vulnerable but COH-compatible bodies
### Mid-Range Terrics
- Archean–Proterozoic Earth analogs    
- marginally breathable worlds    
- variable greenhouse regimes
### High-End Terrics
- super-Earths with 1.2–1.5g    
- dense-atmosphere terranes    
- worlds on the edge of Geotic structure
# Position in the Taxonomy

Terrics are the first “structured” subset of the Biotic Order:

$$\text{Biotic} \supset \text{Terric Domain} \supset \text{Geotic Realm} \supset \text{Gaean Province}$$

Kybelics remain **adjacent** (meliamegic) and not morphotically nested under Terrics.
