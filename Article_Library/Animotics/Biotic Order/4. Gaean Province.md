## Gaean Province

$$
\text{GAEAN} := \left\{ 
\begin{aligned}
&0.50 ≤ m ≤ 1.70 \\
&0.85 ≤ \rho ≤ 1.25 \\
&0.74 ≤ r(m, \rho) ≤ 1.33 \\

> Gaeans form the **habitat-perfect subset** of the Geotic Domain.
> Where Geotics are broadly Earthlike and comfortably habitable, **Gaeans are the apex** — worlds whose physical structure falls into the heart of human biomechanical and ecological preference.

A Gaean world is:
- **freely breathable**
- **walkable without adaptation**    
- **biomechanically effortless**    
- **stable across geologic time**    
- **instinctively familiar** even if alien in ecosystem
    
>$25$% of Geotics are Gaeans.

Gaean = _the Earth-normal sweet spot of parameter space._

## **How to Read This Chart**

This chart shows **where Gaean worlds fall inside larger envelopes**, not the other way around.
That is, the bars answer the question:
> **“Of all Gaeans, what percentage also meet the criteria of each broader class?”**

Because the **Biotic Order** is _much, much larger_ than the Gaean envelope, only a tiny fraction of all Biotic-compliant worlds qualify as Gaeans — but **every single Gaean is still part of the Biotic Order**.

The small percentage for “Biotic Order” therefore reflects the _narrowness of the Gaean slice_, not an exclusion from the parent class.

In short:
- **Small bar ≠ exclusion**    
- **Small bar = Gaeans are a rare, narrow subset inside that much larger envelope**
