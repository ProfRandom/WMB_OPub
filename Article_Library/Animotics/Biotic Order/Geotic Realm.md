## Geotic Realm

m := (0.45 ·· 1.85)⨁
ρ := (0.85 ·· 1.25)⨁
r := (0.70 ·· 1.30)⨁
g := (0.90 ·· 1.10)⨁
vₑ := (0.80 ·· 1.20)⨁

$$
\text{GEOTIC} := \left\{ 
\begin{aligned}
&0.45 ≤ m ≤ 1.85 \\
&0.85 ≤ \rho ≤ 1.25 \\
&0.70 ≤ r(m, \rho) ≤ 1.30 \\
&0.90 ≤ g(m, \rho) ≤ 1.10 \\

>**Geotics** are closer to  **Earthlike** — worlds whose physical properties cluster nearer those of Earth, offering **stable, moderate, and biocompatible environments** that support long-term carbonic life with minimal modification.

They represent the **narrow center band** of the Terric Realm:  
physically close to Earth in gravity, size, composition, and escape energy, but not so human-amegic as the Gaean Province.

Geotics are the **backbone category** for stable, Earth-normal ecosystems.
### Core Features

- **Earth-normal density range** yields terrestrial composition: rocky–metallic silicates with moderate self-compression.    
- **Gravity near 1⨁** ensures familiar biomechanics, atmospheric retention, and hydrological behavior.    
- **Radius and escape velocity** occupy the zone where Earthlike climates and circulation patterns are structurally favored.
    - These values collectively define the **Earthlike structural envelope** without requiring a perfect match.
    
Geotics are the worlds where Earth-based biology can operate naturally, not merely survive.
### Implications and Examples

Geotics include:
- **Earth-analog worlds**  
    Slightly warmer, cooler, wetter, or drier than Earth, but broadly similar.    
- **Moderate super-Earths and sub-Earths**  
    Provided gravity remains close to 1⨁ and escape velocity remains manageable.   
- **Worlds capable of supporting full biomes**  
    Including forests, oceans, complex food webs, and Earth-mode atmospheric dynamics.
    
Geotics may include:
- Planets with minor atmospheric modification needs    
- Worlds with regional extremes but global stability    
- High-oxygen or high-humidity variants still compatible with terragen life
