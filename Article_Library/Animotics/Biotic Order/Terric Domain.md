## Terric Domain

m := ⟨0.30 ∧ 3.35⟩⨁
ρ := ⟨0.85 ∧ 1.25⟩⨁
g := ⟨0.60 ∧ 1.65⟩⨁
r := ⟨0.60 ∧ 1.50⟩⨁
vₑ := ⟨0.65 ∧ 1.50⟩⨁

$$
\text{TERRIC} := \left\{ (m, \rho) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \ \middle|\
\begin{aligned}
&0.30 ≤ m ≤ 3.35 \\
&0.85 ≤ \rho ≤ 1.25 \\
&0.60 ≤ g(m, \rho) ≤ 1.65 \\
&0.60 ≤ r(m, \rho) ≤ 1.50 \\
&0.65 ≤ v_e(m, \rho) ≤ 1.50
\end{aligned}
\right\}

> **Terrics** are **COH-amegic** planemons — solid-surface worlds whose physical and environmental conditions fall within the broad envelope compatible with **carbonic, water-solvent life**, including human physiology.
### Core Features
- **Narrow density bounds** enforce a rocky–metallic–silicate structure typical of terrestrial worlds.    
- **Mass and radius** are allowed more freedom, producing Terrics that range from light sub-Earths to heavy super-Earths.    
- **Gravity and escape velocity** remain within ranges that are biologically tolerable for humans, plants, and Earth-derived biomes.

Terrics form the **primary habitable range** of the Talosic Domain.
### Implications and Examples

Terrics may include:
- **Marginal Earth-twins**  
    Near the edges of Geotic parameters — stable but imperfectly Earthlike.    
- **High-gravity super-Earths**  
    Still habitable, but challenging for human mobility and architecture.    
- **Cooler, lighter Earthlikes**  
    Low-pressure, broad-skied worlds where cold-tolerant biomes thrive.
    
**All Geotics are Terrics**, but not all Terrics meet the tighter Geotic criteria.
