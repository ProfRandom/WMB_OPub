# Relating Stellar Ages to Appearance and Evolution of Life

The earliest fossils of complex multicellular life appear about **600 million years ago**, and the earliest fossils widely accepted as animals are from the phylum _Cnidaria_† — marine species that show up in the record around **580 million years ago** during the late Ediacaran, just before the Cambrian Explosion. Taking the accepted age of the Earth as **4.56 billion years**, this means Earth was about **4.0 billion years old** (~88% of its present age) before complex life began to appear.

If we assume a similar pace of biological development for complex life on other Earth-like exoplanets, then any star with a main sequence lifetime of **≤ 3.0 billion years** would leave its habitable planets without enough time for complex life to evolve indigenously — ending its stable phase at least a billion years too soon. (This does not preclude such worlds from supporting transplanted or migratory complex life.)

On the other hand, the **Great Oxygenation Event**‡ — which shifted Earth’s atmosphere from one dominated by carbon dioxide and methane to one with persistent oxygen levels above ~15% — occurred around **2.4 billion years ago**, when Earth was roughly **2.16 billion years old** (~47% of its current age). The gap between that oxygenation and the first appearance of complex animals was thus about **1.8 billion years**. This suggests that, in principle, complex life _could_ arise at any time after oxygenation, but on Earth the delay was geologically long.

For our purposes, we can specify that an Earth-analog planet must be at least **~2.0 billion years old** to have plausibly developed an aerobic atmosphere by biological means, and at least **~4.0 billion years old** to have produced indigenous complex life. The **minimum** planetary age for being (in)habitable to human colonists is therefore the lesser of these: **~2.0 billion years**.

A star with a main sequence lifetime of **3.0 billion years** could host an Earth-analog planet that had time to produce an oxygenated atmosphere, and then remain stable for roughly another **1 billion years** before leaving the main sequence. Such a system could be colonized by humans or other oxygen-breathing life, even if indigenous complexity had not yet evolved. The next step is to determine which spectral classes meet this **≥ 3 Ga** lifetime criterion.
