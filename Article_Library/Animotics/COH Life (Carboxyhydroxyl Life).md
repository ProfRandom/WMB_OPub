# COH Life (Carboxyhydroxyl Life)

_The Foundational Biochemistry of Terran-Analog Organisms in WMB_
## What “COH” Actually Means

**COH-life** refers to any form of biology whose fundamental chemistry is built around:
- **C**arbon    
- **O**xygen    
- **H**ydrogen    

These three elements form the structural, energetic, and metabolic backbone of what we think of as “Earthlike” life — but the COH definition is _not limited to Terran microbiology_. It is a **generalized biochemical family** defined by:

- **Carbon** as the primary structural element    
- **Oxygen** as the dominant electron acceptor and bond partner    
- **Hydrogen** as both solvent component and reductant
    
This triad produces the **carboxyhydroxyl** chemical regime: a suite of organic molecules with carboxyl, hydroxyl, carbonyl, and related functional groups.
## Why COH and not CHNOPS?
Because CHNOPS is a **list of common elements**, not a _chemical identity class_.

**COH**, by contrast, is:
- thermodynamically meaningful    
- chemically predictive    
- structurally diagnostic    
- habitability-relevant    
- cross-planet applicable    

COH-life describes a _phase of biochemistry_, not a periodic-table checklist.

If a world can sustain **liquid-phase water**, **organic carbon chains**, and **oxygen-mediated energy cycling**, it is COH-life compatible.
## Key Requirements of COH-Life

A COH biosphere depends on:
### 1. Liquid-phase solvents
- Usually water, but COH-life may tolerate supercritical or brine phases.
### 2. Oxidation gradients
- Life must access usable redox pairs — oxygen is the star electron acceptor, but not always the only one.
### 3. Organic carbon chains
- Complex macromolecules built from C, O, H — the basis for:
	- amino acids    
	- sugars    
	- lipids    
	- nucleic analogs
### 4. Stable surface or subsurface environments
- Temperature and pressure must permit:
	- liquid water    
	- flexible organic chemistry    
	- non-degenerate molecular structures
### 5. Planetary-scale recycling
- COH-life thrives on cycling:
	- carbon    
	- oxygen    
	- hydrogen    
	- water    
	- nutrients
— through atmosphere, hydrosphere, or lithosphere.

These conditions are rare cosmically — hence the Biotic → Terric → Geotic → Gaean rarity pyramid.
## What COH-Life Is _Not_

To avoid confusion:
### ❌ Not “Earth clone life.”
- The COH framework allows for:
	- different genetic systems    
	- different amino acids    
	- different polymer backbones    
	- different metabolic pathways    
	- wildly different ecosystems
— but all operating in the _same biochemical envelope_.
### ❌ Not dependent on nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, or trace metals.
- They may be present — often are — but COH-life can exist across a variety of elemental ecosystems.
### ❌ Not limited to oxygenated atmospheres.
- Anaerobic COH-life dominated Earth for ~2.4 billion years.
### ❌ Not tied to human habitability.
- Humans are an extremely narrow COH subcase.  
	- COH-life as a whole is far broader.
# WMB Terminology: “Bio-” vs. “Animo-”
In WMB, the prefix **bio-** applies _only_ to **COH-amegic life** — carbon–oxygen–hydrogen biochemistry operating within the carboxyhydroxyl regime. Terms such as _biochemistry_, _biota_, _biosphere_, and _biogenic processes_ refer specifically to COH-life and COH-ecosystems.

All other varieties of life or life-analog systems fall under the broader concept of **animo-life**, expressed with the prefix **animo-** (from _animegic_, “life-bearing”).  
An **animegic** system is one that can support or give rise to life of _any_ animochemical lineage, not only COH-life.

Common animo-terms include:
- **Animegic** — capable of supporting or generating animotes, regardless of chemical family    
- **Animotics** — study of animegic potential and life-systems broadly    
- **Animogenesis** — processes capable of producing animotes of any lineage    
- **Animozones** — spatial or thermodynamic regions where life of any chemistry may emerge or persist    
- **Animogy** — energy and metabolic principles general to all forms of life    
- **Animotes** — individual life-forms of any chemical lineage    
- **Animota** — ecological assemblies or communities of animotes (the analogue of “biota”)    
- **Animosustents** — substrates, gradients, and resources that sustain animotes of any chemistry
    
When a more specific non-COH life family is defined, WMB names it with its own compositional prefix (e.g., **ferro-** for iron-redox life, **silico-** for silicon-chain biochemistry, **azo-** for nitrogen-redox organisms, etc.).

Thus:

> **COH-life is the only form of life entitled to the “bio-” prefix. All others fall under the broader class of animo-life unless a more specific lineage prefix is formally defined.**

# COH-Life and the Animotic Classes
Animotics classifies worlds by their _physical eligibility_ to support COH-life.  
That hierarchy looks like this:
### Biotic:
- The world is structurally capable of COH biochemistry.
### Terric:
- The world is structurally capable of COH biochemistry _in a human-adjacent envelope_ (parahabitable).
### Geotic:
- The world is physically able to support open-air human habitation.
### Gaean:
- The world comfortably supports human-normal ecosystems and biology.
### Kybelic:
- Superhabitable environments where COH-life thrives at maximal complexity, density, and metabolic richness.

Crucially:
> **Animotic classes describe physical potential, not actualized biospheres.** COH-life may or may not be present on a given Biotic, Terric, or even Geotic world.

Environmental realization is governed by **Milieutics**, not Animotics.
