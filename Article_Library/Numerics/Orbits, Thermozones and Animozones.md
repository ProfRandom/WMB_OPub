# The Nucleal Orbit
The average distance from Earth to the Sun — about $1.496 \times 10^8$ km — is defined as one **astronomical unit (AU)**. Due to Earth’s slightly elliptical orbit, this distance varies by approximately ±2.5 million km between Earth's closest approach to and farthest distance from the Sun.

So, for all practical (and thesiastic) purposes, the Earth's orbital distance (*a*) is a = 1.0AU.  In fact *a* is the commonly used symbol for *any* orbital distance when it is expressed in Astronomical Units.

For our purposes, I have revived an old word from the dusty backroom shelves of English — *nucleal* — and given it new life:

> **Nucleal Orbit** (N): the orbital distance from any given star at which a planemon receives the same stellar irradiance as Earth receives from the Sun at 1 AU.

… and given it the utterly unimaginative symbol, N.

The important thing to note here is that *N is not constant*, but varies from star to star, and it is calculated by:

$$
N = \sqrt{L}
$$
Where:
- *L* = the Luminosity of the star in relative units

Obviously for the Sun:

$$
N = \sqrt{L} = \sqrt{1} = 1
$$
> **Keppy**: So for a dimmer star N shifts closer to the star?

> **Hippy**: And for a brighter star, it shifts farther out from the star.

Correct on both counts.  And once we know N, we can express the **habitable zone** (details coming!) as a proportional range around it.  For instance, for a star of half the Sun's luminosity $L = 0.5⊙$:

$$
N = \sqrt{L} = \sqrt{0.5} = 0.7071\;AU
$$
### The Nucleal Orbit and the Habitable Zone
A quick survey of the existing literature reveals a commonly held definition for the **habitable zone** as:

$$
\langle0.950 \wedge 1.385\rangle N
$$
… or, in other words: between 95% of the nucleal orbit distance to 1.385 times (138.5%) the nucleal orbit distance.  In the case of our hypothetical $L = 0.5⊙$ star and its N nucleal orbit, the range of its habitable zone calculates to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
N &= 0.7071\; AU \\
\text{Inner Edge} &= 0.950 N = (0.950)(0.7071) = \mathbf{0.6717}\; AU \\
\text{Outer Edge} &= 1.385 N = (1.385)(0.7071) = \mathbf{0.9793}\; AU
\end{aligned}
$$
> **Keppy**: So ... the *outer edge* of this star's habitable zone is *closer to its star* than *Earth orbits from the Sun*.....

Exactly.  But, this region is only a part of a total star system.

### The Animozones – Three Habitable Zones
Some scientist posit a wider, more "optimistic habitable zone" region, covering:

$$
\langle0.750 \wedge 1.770\rangle N
$$
For our purposes, it becomes confusing for the optimistic habitable zone to *contain* the conservative habitable zone, so, instead WCB defines *three* zones:

- **Inner Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.750 \wedge 0.950 \rangle N$
- **Central Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.950 \wedge 1.385 \rangle N$
- **Outer Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 1.385 \wedge 1.770 \rangle N$

It has also been suggested that "desert" planemons (think Dune, Tattooine) might orbit in the zone between ⟨0.500 ∧ 0.750⟩N and we might call this the "desert planemon zone", which would be, by definition, **parahabitable** to **habitable** (but mostly the former).

- **Inner Parahabitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.500 \wedge 0.750 \rangle N$
- **Inner Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.750 \wedge 0.950 \rangle N$
- **Central Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.950 \wedge 1.385 \rangle N$
- **Outer Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 1.385 \wedge 1.770 \rangle N$

### The Frost Line (ϝ)
Research indicates that beyond a distance of about $a = 4.850\;AU$ in our Solar system, water cannot remain liquid due to insufficient irradiance from the Sun.  This distance is sometimes termed the "Frost Line" or "Ice Line", and an orbital distance of $a = 4.850N$ is the value we set for this outer limit.

For instance:
- Mars' orbit in our own Solar system is $a = 1.524\;AU$, well within the $1.770N$ limit
- The asteroid belt is ≈ ⟨2.2 ∧ 3.2⟩AU, beyond $1.77N$, but still within the $4.850\;AU$ ϝ limit.  This region in our Solar system does not host a sizeable planemon (and likely never did), but if one were to exist there, it would probably be parahabitable due to the orbital distance from the Sun.

This gives us another range of orbits we can add to our accounting:

- **Inner Parahabitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.500 \wedge 0.750 \rangle N$
- **Inner Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.750 \wedge 0.950 \rangle N$
- **Central Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.950 \wedge 1.385 \rangle N$
- **Outer Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 1.385 \wedge 1.770 \rangle N$
- **Outer Parahabitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 1.770 \wedge 4.850 \rangle N$

Jupiter's orbit is at $a = 5.204\;AU$, well *beyond* the $4.850\;AU$ limit, and things just get colder from there, so we can specify that if any kind of "life" does exist in this region it is likely to be extremophile by Earth standards, which WCB denotes as "***xenotic***".

- **Inner Parahabitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.500 \wedge 0.750 \rangle N$
- **Inner Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.750 \wedge 0.950 \rangle N$
- **Central Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.950 \wedge 1.385 \rangle N$
- **Outer Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 1.385 \wedge 1.770 \rangle N$
- **Outer Parahabitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 1.770 \wedge 4.850 \rangle N$
- **Outer Xenotic Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $4.850N$ →

Similarly, any "life" that might come to be on a body orbiting closer than 0.500N would also be xenotic:

- **Inner Xenotic Zone**
 - Orbital Range: ← $0.500N$
- **Inner Parahabitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.500 \wedge 0.750 \rangle N$
- **Inner Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.750 \wedge 0.950 \rangle N$
- **Central Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.950 \wedge 1.385 \rangle N$
- **Outer Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 1.385 \wedge 1.770 \rangle N$
- **Outer Parahabitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 1.770 \wedge 4.850 \rangle N$
- **Outer Xenotic Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $4.850N$ →

This gives us a full inventory of orbital limits for any star system we choose to devise.

#### Thermozone Limit Notation
For ease of reference, the limiting orbital distances of the thermozones are denoted by an *H* accompanied by a subscript:

$$
\begin{array}{lcl}
0.500N & \rightarrow & H_0 \\
0.750N & \rightarrow & H_1 \\
0.950N & \rightarrow & H_2 \\
1.385N & \rightarrow & H_3 \\
1.770N & \rightarrow & H_4 \\
4.850N & \rightarrow & H_5 \\
\end{array}
$$
## The Animozones
For ease of remembering these zones and their animotic characteristics we use the **Animozone** naming system:

- **Igniozone**: Latin *ignis*, "fire"
- **Calorozone**: Latin *calor*, "hot, heat"
- **Heliozone**: Greek *Helios*, an early name of the Sun god
	- planemons in this region might be somewhat Earth-like in environment, but generally warmer\*
- **Solarazone**: Latin *solar*, from *Sol*, a title of the Sun god
	- planemons in this region are likely to be very Earth-like in their environment\*
- **Hiberozone**: Latin *hiberno*, "cold"
- **Brumazone**: Latin *bruma*, "winter"
- **Cryozone**: Greek *kryo*, "cold"

We can now add the zone limits and the animozone names to our list:

- **Inner Xenotic Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\leftarrow 0.500N$
   - Zone Limits: $\leftarrow H_0$
     - Animozone: *Igniozone*
- **Inner Parahabitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.500 \wedge 0.750 \rangle N$
   - Zone Limits: $\langle H_0 \wedge H_1 \rangle$
     - Animozone: *Calorozone*
- **Inner Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.750 \wedge 0.950 \rangle N$
   - Zone Limits: $\langle H_1 \wedge H_2 \rangle$
     - Animozone: *Heliozone*
- **Central Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.950 \wedge 1.385 \rangle N$
   - Zone Limits: $\langle H_2 \wedge H_3 \rangle$
     - Animozone: *Solarazone*
- **Outer Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 1.385 \wedge 1.770 \rangle N$
   - Zone Limits: $\langle H_3 \wedge H_4 \rangle$
     - Animozone: *Hiberozone*
- **Outer Parahabitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 1.770 \wedge 4.850 \rangle N$
   - Zone Limits: $\langle H_4 \wedge H_5 \rangle$
     - Animozone: *Brumazone*
- **Outer Xenotic Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $4.850N$ →
   - Zone Limits: $H_5 \rightarrow$
     - Animozone: *Cryozone*

Finally, giving each set of zone limits a unique nomenclature:

$$
\begin{array}{rclcl}
\leftarrow 0.500N & \rightarrow & \text{Zone 0} & \rightarrow & Z_0 \\
\langle 0.500 \wedge 0.750 \rangle N & \rightarrow & \text{Zone 1} & \rightarrow & Z_1 \\
\langle 0.750 \wedge 0.950 \rangle N & \rightarrow & \text{Zone 2} & \rightarrow & Z_2 \\
\langle 0.950 \wedge 1.385 \rangle N & \rightarrow & \text{Zone 3} & \rightarrow & Z_3 \\
\langle 1.385 \wedge 1.770 \rangle N & \rightarrow & \text{Zone 4} & \rightarrow & Z_4 \\
\langle 1.770 \wedge 4.850 \rangle N & \rightarrow & \text{Zone 5} & \rightarrow & Z_5 \\
4.850N \rightarrow & \rightarrow & \text{Zone 6} & \rightarrow & Z_6 \\
\end{array}
$$
This gives us our final list of the thermozone nomenclature

- **Inner Xenotic Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\leftarrow 0.500N$
   - Zone Limits: $\leftarrow H_0$
     - Animozone: *Igniozone*
       - Zone 0 ($Z_0$)
- **Inner Parahabitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.500 \wedge 0.750 \rangle N$
   - Zone Limits: $\langle H_0 \wedge H_1 \rangle$
     - Animozone: *Calorozone*
       - Zone 1 ($Z_1$)
- **Inner Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.750 \wedge 0.950 \rangle N$
   - Zone Limits: $\langle H_1 \wedge H_2 \rangle$
     - Animozone: *Heliozone*
       - Zone 2 ($Z_2$)
- **Central Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 0.950 \wedge 1.385 \rangle N$
   - Zone Limits: $\langle H_2 \wedge H_3 \rangle$
     - Animozone: *Solarazone*
       - Zone 3 ($Z_3$)
- **Outer Habitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 1.385 \wedge 1.770 \rangle N$
   - Zone Limits: $\langle H_3 \wedge H_4 \rangle$
     - Animozone: *Hiberozone*
       - Zone 4 ($Z_4$)
- **Outer Parahabitable Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $\langle 1.770 \wedge 4.850 \rangle N$
   - Zone Limits: $\langle H_4 \wedge H_5 \rangle$
     - Animozone: *Brumazone*
       - Zone 5 ($Z_5$)
- **Outer Xenotic Zone**
 - Orbital Range: $4.850N$ →
   - Zone Limits: $H_5 \rightarrow$
     - Animozone: *Cryozone*
       - Zone 6 ($Z_6$)

This gives us a very robust way of discussing orbital distances in any star system.

Note that the *nucleal orbit*, being always $N = 1.0N$, always falls within the Solarazone.  In fact, it always falls at 11.49% *into* the Solarazone from its inner edge.

## The Perannual Orbit
There is one remaining essential star system orbit, which I have called the **perannual** orbit.  The word comes from the Latin *per annum*, meaning "per year" or "each year", and the name reflects that this is the orbit in any star system which has an orbital period (*P*) of exactly one Earth year.

##### IMPORTANT
> "One Earth Year" in this case is the duration of Earth's complete orbit around the Sun relative to the larger reference frame of the "fixed" stars; thus this is called the **sidereal year**, from the Latin *sidus*, "star".  This is measured and denoted in terms of **ephemeris days** — which are *defined* to be exactly 86400 *seconds* in duration. Thus, the sidereal year (and, consequently, the perannual year) has a duration of:

$$
\begin{aligned}
365.256363004 &\quad \text{Ephemeris Days} \\
&or \\
365^d\;6^h\;9^m&\; 9.763545^s
\end{aligned}
$$
> This is *not* a "year" as experienced by inhabitants on the surface of a planemon on this orbit (that is called the **tropical year**, which is in part dependent upon the *rotational period* of the planemon, itself); this is the **sidereal year**.
> 
> Please see [[Units and Measures of Time ✓]] for a more in-depth discussion of this topic.

We denote the perannual year as $P$, and its location in the star system *is not constant* (the same as the *nucleal orbit* (N) but is *determined* by the mass of the star(s), and – to a small but measurable degree – by the mass of the planemon.

The perannual orbit is determined not by the luminosity of the star(s) in the system but by **mass**, mostly of the stars(s), but the mass of the planemon can become a calculatory relevant factor if it is a significant fraction of the mass of the star(s).

The perannual orbit is an *orbital distance*, but it is predicated on the **period** of that orbit — how long it takes the planemon to complete one entire orbit (measured in Earth years).  **ANY** planemon orbital period is calculated (in relative terms) by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	P &= \sqrt{\dfrac{a^3}{M+m}} \\
	a &= \sqrt[3]{P^2 (M+m)} \\
	M + m &= \dfrac{a^3}{P^2} \qquad \text{Believe it or not, this has its uses}
\end{aligned}
$$
Where:
- *P* = the planemon's orbital period in Earth sidereal years
- *a* = the measure of the semi-major axis of the planemon's orbit
- *M* = the mass of the star(s) in Solar masses
- *m* = the mass of the planemon (also expressed in *Solar*) masses

In many cases (such as that of Earth), *m* is such a small number that it can be ignored without drastically altering the value of *P*.  In the case of Earth:

- $M = 1⊙$
- $m = 0.000003003$⊙ ($3.003 \times 10^{-6}$) — three *millionths* of the Sun's mass
- $a = 1\;AU$

Calculating with **only** the Sun's mass:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	P &= \sqrt{\dfrac{a^3}{M}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{1^3}{1}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{1}} = \sqrt{1} = 1\;\text{years}		
\end{aligned}
$$
Calculating with **both** masses:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	P &= \sqrt{\dfrac{a^3}{M + m}} \\
	 &= \sqrt{\dfrac{1^3}{1 + 0.000003003}} \\
	 &= \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{1.000003003}} \\
	 &= \sqrt{0.999997} \\
	 P &= 0.9999985\;\text{years}		
\end{aligned}
$$
… a difference of about 47.384 *seconds*.

> >It may be closer-in than the nucleal orbit (**intranucleal**) or farther out than the nucleal orbit (**extranucleal**).
> >If it is ever *the same as the nucleal orbit*, then the star(s)' mass(es) must be $M = 1⊙$, and — ideally — the planemon's mass must be $m = 1⨁$.
> >Unlike the *nucleal orbit* (which depends on *stellar irradiance*), the perannual orbit *depends only the mass of the system* — and serves as a *temporal* rather than *thermal* reference point.

As shown above, the *distance* of any orbit can be calculated from the period and the masses via:

$$
a = \sqrt[3]{P^2 (M+m)}
$$
… but if we already know that $P = 1$, it drops out of the equation:

$$
a = \sqrt[3]{M+m}
$$
… such that the distance of the orbit is simply the cube-root of the sum of the masses.

For clarity, we denote the *distance* of the perannual orbit with a $P$ (for *perannual*), so our equation becomes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P &= \sqrt[3]{M+m} &&\text{When taking into account both masses} \\
P &= \sqrt[3]{M} &&\text{When using only the central mass} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
We have explored both [[M002 - Stars — 03 The Nucleal Orbit ✓|The Nucleal Orbit]] and [[M002 - Stars — 05 The Perannual Orbit ✓|The Perannual Orbit]].  These two are not *limiting distances*, but **orbital environs** which both describe and contribute to the animotic nature of planemons.

As a quick review:
- **Nucleal Orbit**: that orbit (expressed in AU) at which a planemon receives from its star(s) the same radiant flux as Earth receives from the Sun at one Astronomical Unit distance, calculated by: 

$$
	N = \sqrt{L}
$$

Where *L* = Luminosity of the star(s) as expressed in Solar units, ⊙

- **Perannual Orbit**: that orbit (expressed in AU) which has an orbital period of exactly one sidereal Earth year, calculated by:

$$
P = \sqrt[3]{M+m}
$$
If we disregard the mass of the planemon *m*:

$$
P = \sqrt[3]{M}
$$
And we saw in [[M002 - Stars — 02 Parameters ✓]] that through relationship:

$$
M = \sqrt[3]{L}
$$
This means that:
- The perannual orbit can be *approximated* directly from the luminosity by:

$$
P \approx \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{L}} \approx \sqrt[6]{L}
$$
- The nucleal orbit can be *approximated* directly from the mass by:

$$
N \approx \sqrt{M^3}
$$
And, by extension either can be *approximated* from the other by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P &\approx \sqrt[6]{N^2} \approx \sqrt[3]{N} \\
N &\approx P^3
\end{aligned}
$$
**REMEMBER**
- Both N and $P$ are measured in astronomical units, not time!
- These last four equations are **approximations**; in most cases they'll be "accurate enough", but calculatingN and $P$ robustly is always advised.
 
$$
\frac{1 - 0.95}{1.385-0.95} = \frac{1 - 0.50}{4.85-0.50} \approx 0.11494
