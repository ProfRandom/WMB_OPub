# Duramon Physical Parameters

Duramonic bodies are defined by five quantitative parameters, each belonging to a distinct tier of causality. Two of these — mass and density — describe the duramon’s intrinsic matter. Their interaction produces the consequent parameters, surface gravity and radius. Together, they generate the emergent dynamical parameter: escape velocity.

Duramonic parameters are grouped into tiers not by convenience, but by causality: primaries _define_ the consequents, and together they _generate_ the emergent.

## Primary Properties

**Mass** ($m$):  
The total amount of matter the duramon contains.  
*Mass is invariant* — it does not change with location or gravity.  
> *Mass and weight are not the same: weight depends on gravity, but mass does not.*

**Density** ($ρ$):  
The average amount of matter per unit volume — how tightly the duramon’s material is packed. Density depends on both composition (rock, ice, metal, etc.) and, for larger bodies, gravitational self-compression.

## The Consequents

**Surface Gravity** ($g$):  
The strength of gravitational acceleration at the duramon’s surface — how strongly it attracts objects located one radius away from its center.  

Gravity is **consequent**, arising from the interaction of mass and density:

$$
g = \sqrt[3]{mρ^{2}}
$$

Together, mass and density _produce_ the duramon’s consequent parameters.

They describe what the body *is* and how it *acts* gravitationally.

**Radius** ($r$):  
The distance from the duramon’s center to its surface.  
Radius is also **consequent**, also arising from the interaction of mass and density:

$$
r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{m}{ρ}}
$$
## The Emergent

**Escape Velocity** ($v_e$):  
The minimum speed required to escape the duramon’s gravitational field when starting from its surface.

This property emerges from the consequents:

$$
v_e = \sqrt{g\, r}
$$
Escape velocity represents the energy threshold imposed by the duramon’s gravitational well — the “height” of its gravity.
## Hierarchy of Dependence

Duramonic properties follow a clear causal chain, in which the **primary** properties ($m, \rho$) *define* the **consequent** properties ($g, r$), and together these *form* the **emergent** property ($v_e$):

\end{aligned}
$$
## A familiar analogy

The classic riddle “Which is heavier — a pound of iron or a pound of feathers?” demonstrates the independence of *mass* from *density*.  

Both *weigh* the same, but the feathers occupy far more *volume* because they are less dense.  

The same principle applies on planetary scales: a rocky duramon and an icy duramon of equal mass can differ greatly in radius, surface gravity, and escape velocity.
