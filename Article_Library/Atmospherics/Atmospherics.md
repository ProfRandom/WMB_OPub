# **Atmospherics: Planetary Atmospheric Behavior States**

Atmospherics describe **how a planet’s atmosphere behaves**, independent of its Climostatic (biomic) state. These modifiers characterize storminess, circulation energy, and the general _temperament_ of the weather.

Each atmospheric state can pair with any Climostatic biome:

> **Tempestal Saharic World**  
> **Zephyral Austeric World**  
> **Serenal Amazonic World**  
> **Tempestal Boreic World**  
> etc.

## 1️⃣ Tempestal

### Definition

A Tempestal world has a **high-energy atmosphere** prone to:
- frequent storms    
- powerful cyclones    
- intense convection    
- recurring hurricanes or supercells    
- extreme seasonal weather swings    

Weather is **active, violent, and often unpredictable**. These planets have strong circulation cells, high thermal gradients, or unusually energetic atmospheres.
### Example

A **Tempestal Boreic World** would be a planet whose surface is dominated by **boreal forests**, yet experiences **frequent powerful storms**, blizzards, or supercell outbreaks — like a hypercharged, cyclone-streaked subarctic world.

A **Tempestal Saharic World** might be a dune planet wracked by **planet-wide sandstorms**.

## 2️⃣ Zephyral

### Definition

A Zephyral world has a **low-energy atmospheric circulation**, marked by:
- light, gentle winds    
- mild storm activity    
- stable pressure systems    
- low turbulence    
- calm to moderately calm weather overall    

This is the “pleasant weather” class — not motionless, but never violent.
### Example

A **Zephyral Austeric World** would be a world dominated by **temperate deciduous forests**, experiencing **stable, mild seasons** and **gentle breezes** — peaceful, temperate, and fertile.

A **Zephyral Prairic World** might resemble a calm, lightly wind-swept grassland planet.

## 3️⃣ Serenal

### **Definition**

A Serenal world has an **exceptionally calm atmosphere**, often described as:
- nearly windless    
- low-turbulence    
- stable across seasons    
- gentle precipitation    
- minimal convective activity
    
The entire climate feels _tranquil_, almost meditative — the atmospheric equivalent of a smooth lake.
### Example

A **Serenal Amazonic World** would be a **tropical rainforest planet** with **surprisingly gentle weather** — misty rains, quiet humidity, and a remarkably stable climate.

A **Serenal Tundric World** might be a cold, soft-spoken tundra planet with **near-motionless air** and very gradual seasonal shifts.
