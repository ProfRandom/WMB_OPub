# Plot Holes and Potholes
# 🧩 Plot Holes and the Continuity of Story

**Plot holes break stories.**

A **plot hole** is a *mythosic inconsistency* — a point where the sequence or causality of a narrative fails to agree with itself.  

It’s the story-level counterpart to a **pothole**: an error not in physics or cosmology, but in the logic of events, motivations, or information.  

> **Example — The Vanishing Sword:**  
> A hero’s blade shatters in chapter seven, yet reappears unbroken in chapter nine.  
> The reader’s mind stumbles: *“Wait — didn’t that sword break?”* 
> 
> Attention shifts from empathy (*“will she win?”*) to dissonance (*“the story forgot itself”*), and the thread of belief is cut.

# 🧩 Potholes and the Consistency of Reality

**Potholes break the cosmos.**

A **pothole** is a *logosic inconsistency* — a fracture in the physics, construction, or functional logic of the underlying reality-framework that snaps the illusion of a coherent environment, often in ways obvious even to casual readers or players.

> **Example — The Sudden Third Moon:**  
> A world has two well-established moons. Then, midway through the story, a third moon casually appears in the sky — unnamed, unremarked, and never mentioned before or after.
> 
> The reader stumbles: *“Where did that third moon come from?”*  The cosmos contradicts itself, and the illusion of a coherent reality fractures.
### Why It Matters
- Plot holes rupture **continuity** — the narrative flow that carries readers through cause, effect, and emotional development.  
- They weaken *trust* between storyteller and audience: when events do not follow, stakes lose weight and outcomes lose meaning.  
- The story ceases to feel discoverable; it starts to feel contrived.

### Prevention
Plot holes close easily when the creator honors the same **[[The SANC Charter|SANC Charter]]** that governs WMB worldcraft:
- keep the chain of events **Sufficient and Necessary** — every action must have a reason *and* a result,  
- verify cause, consequence, and chronology,  
- and use **revision** the way physics uses conservation — nothing disappears without leaving a trace.

### In Short
> **Continuity keeps the story straight.**  
> **Consistency keeps the cosmos sound.**

Together they form the dual obligations of **World*making****:  
- one to the *mythosic weave* of narrative,  
- the other to the *logosic fabric* of the cosmos itself.
