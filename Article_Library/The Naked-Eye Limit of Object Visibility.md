# The Naked-Eye Limit of Object Visibility

Even without a telescope, the human eye is a sensitive instrument.  
Under a perfectly dark, moonless sky far from city lights, a person with average eyesight can see stars down to about **magnitude 6.0** — roughly **one-millionth** as bright as the faintest stars that remain visible from a town.

But brightness isn’t everything. A planet, asteroid, or moonlet that *reflects* light rather than producing its own must also be **large enough** and **close enough** for its surface area to gather and scatter enough starlight toward the observer.

In practice:

| Sky Condition     | Naked-Eye Limit | Example                                    |
| :---------------- | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| City sky          | ≈ mag 3         | Only the brightest dozen stars and planets |
| Suburban sky      | ≈ mag 4.5       | Dozens of stars; Milky Way faintly hinted  |
| Rural dark site   | ≈ mag 6         | Several thousand stars visible             |
| High desert / sea | ≈ mag 6.5 – 7   | Milky Way casts a faint shadow             |

The *naked-eye limit* defines the practical boundary between **visible** and **imagined** objects in a sky.

When worldbuilding, anything dimmer than about **mag 6** should be considered invisible to ordinary people unless aided by magic, technology, or narrative emphasis.
