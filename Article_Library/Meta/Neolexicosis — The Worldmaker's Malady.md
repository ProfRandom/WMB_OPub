# 🧩 The Three Lexical Orders of WMB

WMB draws its vocabulary from three distinct “lexical orders,” each reflecting a different relationship between language and worldmaking intent. This taxonomy explains *how* terms enter the corpus and *why* they take the forms they do.
## 1. Neolex — New words the corpus invents for itself

**Definition:**  
A **Neolex** is a term coined outright within WMB — a true *neologism*.[^1]  
It expresses a concept that real-world language either lacks entirely or handles with unnecessary vagueness, complexity, or historical accident.

**Purpose:**  
To create precise, intuitive, reusable conceptual handles for worldmaking.

**Examples:**
- **Planemon, stellamon, duramon, peramon** — systematic mononic conformations.  
- **Tempostat** — the calendrical zero-point.  
- **Cascading Rounding Notation (CRN)** — a bespoke solution to a bespoke problem.  
- **GEWE** — a narrative-coherence principle that deserved a name.  
- **Resultant** — a general term for the post-operation value in calculations.  
- **Chronal Station, Sectal, Quartal** — time-geometry terminology invented for clarity.  
- **Morphotics, Conformics, Animotics, Milieutics** — named domains of worldmaking.

**Used when:**  
Clarity beats heritage, or no existing term expresses the idea cleanly.
## 2. Exolex — Borrowed intact from external science

**Definition:**  
An **Exolex** is a term imported without modification from astronomy, physics, mathematics, or another technical field. It arrives with its conventional meaning; WMB adapts to it, not the other way around.

**Purpose:**  
To avoid reinventing the wheel when a real-world term is already elegant and unambiguous.

**Examples:**
- **Roche limit**  
- **Hill sphere**  
- **Aphelion, periapsis** (used in their standard senses)  
- **Luminosity, albedo, eccentricity**  
- **Harmonics, resonances**

**Used when:**  
A real term is widely understood, precise, and fits WMB’s internal logic.

> [!note] The Indifference of Pragmatism  
> “Hill sphere” survives.  
> “Kozai–Lidov mechanism” silently wishes it could.

## 3. Insulex — Common words given specialized meanings inside WMB

**Definition:**  
An **Insulex** is an ordinary English word that WMB retools with a narrowed, technical sense appropriate to the corpus.

**Purpose:**  
To provide intuitive vocabulary that carries familiar connotations but has precise scope.

**Examples:**
- **Worldcrafting** — constructing the logosic content of reality.  
- **Worldbuilding** — shaping the mythosic context of living within it.  
- **Milieutics** — environmental and situational context of setting.  
- **Domain** — one of the six major structural areas of WMB.  
- **Station** — a specific position or moment in orbital geometry.

**Used when:**  
Familiarity helps comprehension, but precision is still required.

## ⭐ Why these three matter

Together, **Neolex**, **Exolex**, and **Insulex** create WMB’s vocabulary strategy:

- **Neolex** → invention for clarity  
- **Exolex** → inheritance for stability  
- **Insulex** → specialization for coherence  

This triad keeps WMB’s language expressive, intuitive, and structurally sound.
## The Structural Necessity of New Terms

As world systems grow, inherited vocabularies eventually reach their limits.  Real-world terminology was designed for real-world science, not for coherent fictional cosmologies, parametric conformations, or meta-mythic architectures. As WMB expanded, some concepts simply outgrew the language available to describe them.  

When the conceptual load exceeds the expressiveness of ordinary terminology, **new words become structurally necessary**, not ornamental.  Neolexicosis is thus not indulgence — it is the linguistic evolution required by a growing, internally consistent universe.

> [!tip] **A Worldmaker’s Immunity**
> Neolexicosis never really goes away.  
> The best a creator can do is manage the symptoms:
> - resist the urge when the old word truly works,  
> - embrace it when the new word brings clarity, and  
> - accept that sometimes your brain invents vocabulary faster than you can document it.
> 
> Worldmakers aren’t cured of Neolexicosis.  
> They simply learn to live *productively* with it.
