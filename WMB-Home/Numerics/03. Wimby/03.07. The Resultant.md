# The Resultant

A **resultant** is the end result of any mathematical operation, especially
when the specific traditional term (e.g., quotient, product, difference,
remainder) is unknown, irrelevant, would distract from the point being made —
or simply doesn't exist.

Use the standard term when it is clear and helpful; otherwise, “resultant”
serves as a general-purpose placeholder that keeps the narrative moving and
avoids unnecessary terminology detours.

***Examples***:
- **Numeric**:
	- “The **resultant** is $3.1416 \longleftarrow 3.1415(9)$.”
	- "The **resultant** is $1.618 \longleftarrow 1.618'03399$."
- **General**:
	- “Divide by the mass and use that **resultant** in the next step.”
