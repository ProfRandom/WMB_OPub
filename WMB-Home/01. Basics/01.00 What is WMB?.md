# What Is Worldmaking Basics (WMB)
**Worldmaking Basics (WMB; Wimby to its friends)** is a system for designing fictional worlds that are _coherent_, _inventive_, and _fun to inhabit_ — both for you and for your audience.

Most guides to worldbuilding focus on the **mythos**:  
	religion, politics, society, language, culture, character, and story.  

That work is essential — it gives a world its _continuity_, the human-facing threads that make it feel lived-in.

But worlds also need **logos**:  
	the physics, cosmology, structure, and ontological “ground rules” that determine _how the universe works_ in the first place.

Wimby calls these two halves:
- **World_building_** → _mythos_    
- **World_crafting_** → _logos_
    
Together, they form:

> **World_making_** — the art of weaving mythos and logos into one [[01.02. Plot Holes and Potholes|coherent whole]].

Most creators begin with building: characters, countries, conflicts.  

Wimby begins with **crafting**, because:

- your cultures depend on your climates,    
- your climates depend on your world’s orbit,    
- your orbit depends on your star,    
- your star depends on its physics,    
- and everything downstream flows from everything upstream.    

- Craft the stage well, and your story begins to _suggest itself_.  
- Worldcrafting isn’t restrictive — it’s generative.  
- Great physics reveals great plot hooks.

Yet while the internet is overflowing with lore guides, there’s no one-stop resource that teaches creators how to **design the physical universe itself** — let alone one that:
- [[01.03. The SANC Charter|stays science-adjacent and avoids calculus]],
- tays grounded in clear reasoning without enforcing realism as dogma,    
- prioritizes clarity,    
- [[01.04. The GEWE Corollary|and protects complete creative freedom for the worldmaker]].    

That is what Wimby offers:
- a **logosic foundation** that is rigorous but not rigid,    
- a **mythos-friendly structure** that supports rather than constrains,    
- and a **philosophy of coherence** that lets your worlds feel discoverable rather than invented.    

You don’t need a physics degree.  
You just need curiosity, imagination, and a willingness to learn the underlying patterns.

Everything in Phase I of Wimby is meant to give you:
- the conceptual framework (**Meta**)    
- the ontology of what exists (**Ontics**)    
- and the quantitative tools to work with it (**Metrics**)    

You can read Wimby front to back, or wander through it like a forest of ideas — every page stands alone, but each link leads deeper.

**Start where you like.  
The world you make will take you the rest of the way.**
