 # 🚫 When *Not* to Use GEWE

[[01.04. The GEWE Corollary]] is powerful — but misused, it becomes an excuse for sloppy craft.  
There are times when bending the rules weakens the world instead of strengthening it.

Use GEWE **wisely**, not ***whenever***.

## ❌ 1. When Consistency Is the Point
If your story hinges on the reliability of:

- a magic system  
- a technology  
- a cosmology  
- an ecology  
- a political structure  

…then violating its own rules breaks trust.

Readers don’t mind a flexible world.  
They hate an *incoherent* one — Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett, the patron saints of absurdity, played by rules they never broke.  Theirs are examples worthy of following.

GEWE is for bending, not reneging.

## ❌ 2. When the Correction Is Easy
If the problem can be fixed by:

- tweaking a number,  
- renaming a metal,  
- nudging an orbit,  
- moving a mountain,  
- adjusting a timeline,  

…then do the fix.

GEWE is not for avoiding small, painless edits.

## ❌ 3. When It Creates a Bigger Problem Later
A cool exception today can become a continuity nightmare tomorrow.

Examples:

- Making the sun “a tiny bit magic”  
- Letting time-travel work one time because it’s convenient  
- Letting a species break its own biology for a single scene  

GEWE is not a patch over a load-bearing beam.

## ❌ 4. When It Breaks Reader Expectations
If the genre, tone, or genre-contract demands internal rigor:

- hard SF  
- tightly constructed mysteries  
- political thrillers  
- stories about engineers/scientists  
- grimdark survival tales  

…then GEWE can feel like cheating.

Even fantasy readers expect **internal logic**, even if the logic is magical.

## ❌ 5. When It Undermines a Character or Theme
If the exception:

- invalidates a sacrifice  
- erases a consequence  
- contradicts a theme  
- weakens character agency  

…don’t use GEWE.

Story coherence always outranks convenience.

## ❌ 6. When It Becomes a Habit
If “GEWE will save me” becomes your plan,  
you’re no longer bending rules — you’re relying on them breaking.

That’s the opposite of worldmaking integrity.

# ✔ The Litmus Test

Before invoking GEWE, ask:

**“Does this bend deepen the story, or just avoid work?”**

If it deepens the story → GEWE approved.  
If it just avoids work → revise the world.

GEWE is permission, not permission *slipshod*.

# Final Words
All the above being said… if you trim your planet’s “month” to a neat 32.5 days instead of what you calculated as 32.60237 days, and you’re fairly sure no one is going to sit down with a calculator to catch you out...?

_Mundus tuum est_.
