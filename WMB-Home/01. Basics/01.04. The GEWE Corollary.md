# 🧩 GEWE — Good Enough for Worldmaking Efforts

## 🧩 Definition  
**GEWE** stands for **Good Enough for Worldmaking Efforts.**

It marks the **pragmatic threshold of adequacy** — the moment when the *needs of the story, culture, drama, or play experience* legitimately outweigh strict technical precision.

Think of it as the creator’s quiet permission slip:

> *Mundus meum est* — “It’s **my** world.”

GEWE exists for the times when a world works better if you bend truth a little rather than break the story a lot.

It’s not sloppiness.  
It’s **intentional deviation in service of coherence.**

# 🌍 Examples Across Crafting and Building

## **Astronomical (Logos → Mythos)**

- The orbital calculation says the year is 319.789 days.  
  The story says:  
  **Call it 320. Move on.**

- A Mars-sized moon shouldn’t survive that close to a gas giant.  
  But your sacred solstice rite needs it looming over the ocean.  
  **Drama wins.**

## **Biological**

- Real-world mules are sterile.  
  But Book Three depends on a prize-winning mule siring offspring.  
  **GEWE smiles.**

- The apex predator should gestate for months.  
  Your plot needs “eggs hatch overnight.”  
  **Approved.**

## **Cultural / Sociological**

- A medieval village couldn’t support three specialized guilds.  
  But narratively, it’s a cultural crossroads.  
  **Mythos says yes.**

- The floating sky-city is economically ridiculous.  
  But symbolically essential.  
  **GEWE keeps it aloft.**

## **Magical / Metaphysical**

- Your magic system has rules.  
  The gods have exceptions.  
  **GEWE considers this a feature.**

- The reservoir is finite…  
  …except when the protagonist truly needs one more spell.  
  **This once, she reaches deeper.**

## **Ecological / Environmental**

- The planet should be frozen at that albedo and semi-major axis.  
  But you need a thriving temperate forest.  
  **“Unmodeled greenhouse factor. Done.”**

- This valley has implausible biodiversity.  
  **It’s a refugium.** No further questions.

## **Physics / Technology**

- The power budget says no simultaneous life support *and* full weapons.  
  The set-piece battle says otherwise.  
  **Experimental capacitor bank. Next problem.**

- FTL messages violate causality?  
  **Only if you let them.**

# 🎭 Core Principle

“So,” you may be asking, “why have WMB at all if I can ignore it?”

Because WMB exists to give you **two legitimate creative paths**:

1. **Honor the physics and let the story adapt**, or  
2. **Ignore the physics intelligently when the story demands it.**

GEWE is not about handwaving.  
It’s about choosing **coherence of experience** over **coherence of calculation** when the two collide.

When story, character, emotion, theme, symbolism, cadence, or gameplay would suffer under strict precision, GEWE steps forward and says:

> **“Bend the rule, not the world.”**

Let [[03.03. Cascading Rounding Notation]] handle the numeric honesty.  
Let **GEWE** protect the narrative truth.

But remember that though you are the first-and-final arbiter, you still have a responsibility to your milieu.  Check out [[01.05. To GEWE or Not To GEWE]] for some advice.
